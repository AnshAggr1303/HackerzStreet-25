SAFETY ASSESSMENT Safety assessment is the process that results in an acceptable daily intake ADI of speciﬁc chemi cals. Safety assessment has been carried out in theUnited States and much of the Western worldsince the late nineteenth century.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,24,Since the 1950sit has become much more formalized in its use byregulatory agencies to incorporate animal toxicol ogy studies and potential exposures. Safety assess ment starts with the underlying premise that expo sure to a chemical be it a drug food additive cosmetics ingredients or consumer product willoccur. It also relies on animal toxicology studies. The assumption made is that humans are moresensitive to these chemicals than the most sensitiveanimal species tested.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,25,Acute toxicity studies are used to determine the potential for poisoning as well as possibleantidotes. The acute LD50 that dose that is lethalto 50 of the animals tested is seldom directlyextrapolated from animals to man but many occu pational exposure standards and categorizationsof household chemicals are based on the LD50.Safety assessment for direct food additives such ascolorants or ﬂavors is based on the no observableeffect level NOEL in laboratory animals or on anapproximation of that level.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,26,The ADI is deter mined from the NOEL with appropriate safetyfactors and is based on the percentage of anydietary component that contains the chemical sothat if a person consumes a kilogram of food perday and the compound of interest is only found in10 percent of the food products generally con sumed that 10 percent becomes the exposuremaximum that is used in the calculations.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,27,Safety assessment for therapeutic agents is also based on animal toxicity but it is also afunction of the doses to be used the diseases to betreated and the conditions of the treated popula tions. As an example the safety assessment of anover the counter OTC drug is more stringentthan for a drug to be used for the treatment of alife threatening situation.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,28,A therapeutic index TI is developed for almost all drugs and is based onthe ratio of the toxic dose to the efﬁcacious dose The greater the ratio the greater the margin ofsafety in use of the drug. A drug being used forcancer chemotherapy can have a greater toxicityand a much smaller TI than a drug for the com mon cold. A cancer patient may be in a life threatening situation but a doctor or nurse ismonitoring his or her signs and symptoms oftoxicity.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,29,In contrast an individual may be takinguncontrolled amounts of a cold preparation and isprobably not being monitored by a health profes sional. The other issue in this example is that thereis a much larger consumer population for OTCproducts than for chemotherapeutic products andthe risks of OTC drugs may not be as well appreci ated. Hence the involuntary risk taker must bemore protected. SAFETY FACTORS 1060Consumer products present a different chal lenge for safety assessment.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,30,The assumption hereis that the consumer of a household product willingest or touch the product or inhale vapors fromthe product. The product is manufactured forsomething other than consumption and the pack aging has to be part of the safety assessment. Forexample a household cleanser may be caustic andhighly oxidizing. This product will cause extremedamage to tissues and the risk is known fromanimal studies or by analogy to other chemicals ofthe same class.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,31,The only way to assure less risk tothe user is through strong vivid unequivocal la beling and childproof packaging. Pesticides present a special case in safety as sessment. First most pesticides are designed tocontrol and or kill pests. By deﬁnition pesticides especially insecticides are moderately or highlytoxic when compared to most other consumer products.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,32,The safety assessment and toxicologypackage for a pesticide depends on whether it is going to be registered as a crop chemical a chemi cal for ornamental ﬂowers a home use pesticide or some other use. The crop chemicals be theyinsecticides herbicides fungicides or growth regu lators complete a battery of tests from in vitrothrough carcinogenicity.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,33,The logic being that con sumers could be exposed to minute amounts ofresidues from application to the crops and theremust be a large margin of safety between potentialexposure and toxicity. Again an ADI is establishedbased on the toxicity of the chemical the NOEL the shape of the dose response curve the amountof a particular crop in a food product how muchmay be eaten or drunk and the body weight orsurface area of the consumer children are specialcases .
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,34,This information allows the regulators toestablish an ADI expressed in milligrams ormicrograms of a chemical that can be consumedsafely in a day. ADIs are also set for differentdurations of exposure but usually for a greaterpart of the lifetime. Safety assessment differs from cancer risk as sessment in several ways. Safety assessments arefor multiple endpoints not just cancer and can befor multiple time points.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,35,Threshold limit values TLVs are examples of safety assessments that canbe set for acute toxicity eye irritation or systemictoxicity. Safety assessments arrive at an exposureor dose limit and are not expressed as a probabil ity which cancer risk assessments are. Safety as sessments are similar throughout the world.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,36,M ICHAEL GALLO SEE ALSO In Vivo and In Vitro Testing Risk Assessment Risk Management Safety Factors Toxicology SAFETY FACTORS Safety factors have been used to protect the public health since the advent of modern safety assess ment. Originally based on very little experimentaldata the concept of safety factors was based on thepremise that humans are more sensitive to chemi cals and environmental agents than the most sensi tive laboratory animal.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,37,By the time of World War I experimental evidence with laboratory animalswas being directly compared with ﬁndings in hu mans. It was evident that the original premise hadlittle basis in fact but was still a prudent approachfor public health. As novel organic molecules werebeing developed as drugs and insecticides in the1930s and 1940s the concept of safety factors gavescientists and regulators some comfort that thepublic was being protected. Actual data on safetyfactors is still incomplete.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,38,For many highly toxic compounds humans are almost identical to laboratory animals in sensi tivity. However there are startling examples suchas thalidomide and some retinoic acid analogs where humans are much more sensitive than labo ratory animals. Several attempts have been madeto quantify the physiological and toxicological dif ferences across species.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,39,For the basic physiologicalsystems that are essential for all mammalian spe cies the responses to many classes of chemicals drugs and physical agents are similar. The basic assumptions underlying the use of safety factors is that by using these factors the public health is protected and special populationsare also protected.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,40,Further assumptions hold thathumans are somewhere between 10 and 1 000 times more sensitive to some toxic agents than areanimals adults are less sensitive than children andthe aged are more sensitive than younger individu als. Hence a safety assessment can be conducted SALMONELLOSIS 1061using the proper toxicological evaluation with multi ple species of animals to establish the NOEL noobservable effect level or its equivalent.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,41,The asses sor can then use safety factors for species to spe cies extrapolation usually a factor of ten or more which involves multiplying the NOEL by a tenfoldfactor for age differences and perhaps a tenfoldfactor for special populations. Hypothetically if aNOEL established for Chemical A at 1 000 milli grams per kilogram body weight of the laboratoryrat per day the assessor could compute the safetyfactors and conclude that a safe dose would be 1milligram per kilogram per day.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,42,This is a simple case and many other variables can be added. For an occupational exposure onemight add a factor for hours worked compared tohours used in the tests. For an immunotoxic agentthere might be a greater safety factor used forspecies or age comparison particularly if childrenor the aged are exposed. The uncertainties sur rounding testing for adverse birth outcomes usu ally result in the use of greater safety factors.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,43,The rationale for additional safety factors for children has evolved over several years. Originally children were looked on as small adults and theirphysiological differences especially the rapid de velopment and remarkable tissue and organ sys tems changes of children were not given as muchas attention as necessary. Recently the emphasishas been on understanding how seemingly modestor small changes in a developing system can per manently alter that system when it matures.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,44,Greatercare is now going into using safety factors forchildren. More basic research is still necessary toprotect children and until that work is completedthe prudent approach has been to increase thesafety factors for children. Safety factors are widely used by regulators throughout the world. Some countries use safetyfactors for assessing the exposures to some car cinogens.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,45,The United States generally uses a quan titative risk assessment QRA approach to car cinogens but uses a modiﬁcation of the originalsafety factor approach for most other toxic end points. Safety factors were used exclusively untilthe late 1960s and early 1970s when the QRAmethodologies were developed.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,46,The U.S. NationalAcademy of Sciences National Research Councilhas through its many studies on drinking water food additives and others types of chemicals pub lished a rich history of the rationale and use ofsafety factors.

The nameis derived from the American veterinary surgeon Daniel A. Salmon who described Salmonella cholerae suis as the cause of hog cholera in 1885.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,50,Since then over 2 200 Salmonella serotypes have been de scribed each is distinguished by its unique combi nation of cell wall ﬂagella and capsular antigens.Many serotypes are further subdivided usually forepidemiological studies by their sensitivity to stan dard sets of bacteriophages phage typing andDNA ﬁngerprinting methods. Salmonella are found in the intestinal tract of animals and birds includ ing domestic species e.g. cattle poultry wildanimals and pets.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,51,Most human infections are SAMPLING 1062caused by a few serotypes commonly S. typhimurium and S. enteritidis . In most countries that keep na tional statistics the majority of human cases aredue to only ﬁve to ten common serotypes. Salmonellosis is characterized by diarrhea headache abdominal pain fever and vomiting beginning 6 to 72 hours usually 6 to 36 hours after infection. Healthy people normally recoverwithin a week.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,52,Some individuals however are more susceptible to serious illness see Table 1 and there is increasing evidence of longer termsequelae occurring in a small proportion of cases. Speciﬁc Salmonella serotypes are adapted to speciﬁc hosts in which they usually cause septicae mia. For example Salmonella typhi is the cause of typhoid in man. Human infection is linked to adiverse variety of foods possibly contaminated byanimal or human feces during slaughter or duringcultivation harvesting and preparation.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,53,Foodsmost commonly linked to illness include those ofanimal origin such as meat products unpasteurizedmilk poultry and eggs foods contaminated dur ing cultivation or preparation including vegeta bles salads fruit and less commonly processedfoods such as chocolate and snack products.

SAMPLING In many disciplines there is often a need to de scribe the characteristics of some large entity such SAMPLING 1063as the air quality in a region the prevalence of smoking in the general population or the outputfrom a production line of a pharmaceutical com pany. Due to practical considerations it is impossi ble to assay the entire atmosphere interview everyperson in the nation or test every pill.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,61,Sampling isthe process whereby information is obtained fromselected parts of an entity with the aim of makinggeneral statements that apply to the entity as awhole or an identiﬁable part of it. Opinion pollstersuse sampling to gauge political allegiances or pref erences for brands of commercial products whereaswater quality engineers employed by public healthdepartments will take samples of water to makesure it is ﬁt to drink.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,62,The process of drawingconclusions about the larger entity based on theinformation contained in a sample is known asstatistical inference. There are several advantages to using sam pling rather than conducting measurements on anentire population. An important advantage is theconsiderable savings in time and money that canresult from collecting information from a muchsmaller population.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,63,When sampling individuals the reduced number of subjects that need to becontacted may allow more resources to be devotedto ﬁnding and persuading nonresponders to par ticipate. The information collected using samplingis often more accurate as greater effort can beexpended on the training of interviewers moresophisticated and expensive measurement devicescan be used repeated measurements can be taken and more detailed questions can be posed.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,64,DEFINITIONS The term target population is commonly used to refer to the group of people or entities the uni verse to which the ﬁndings of the sample are tobe generalized. The sampling unit is the basicunit e.g. person household pill around which asampling procedure is planned.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,65,For instance ifone wanted to apply sampling methods to estimatethe prevalence of diabetes in a population thesampling unit would be persons whereas house holds would be the sampling unit for a study todetermine the number of households where one or more persons were smokers. The samplingframe is any list of all the sampling units in thetarget population.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,66,Although a complete list of allindividuals in a population is rarely available analphabetic listing of residents in a community or of registered voters are examples of sampling frames. SAMPLING METHODS The general goal of all sampling methods is to obtain a sample that is representative of the targetpopulation. In other words apart from randomerror the information derived from the sample isexpected to be the same had a complete census ofthe target population been carried out.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,67,The proce dures used to select a sample require some priorknowledge of the target population which allows adetermination of the size of the sample needed toachieve a reasonable estimate with accepted pre cision and accuracy of the characteristics of thepopulation. Most sampling methods attempt toselect units such that each has a deﬁnable proba bility of being chosen. Methods that adopt thisapproach are called probability sampling meth ods.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,68,Examples of such methods include simplerandom sampling systematic sampling stratiﬁedsampling and cluster sampling. A random sample is one where every person or unit in the population from which the sampleis drawn has some chance of being included in it.Ideally the selections that make up the sample aremade independently that is the choice to selectone unit will not affect the chance of another unitbeing selected.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,69,The simplest way of selecting sam pling units where each unit has an equal probabil ity of being chosen is referred to as a simplerandom sample. Systematic random sampling involves decid ing what fraction of the target population is to besampled and then compiling an ordered list of thetarget population. The ordering may be based onthe date a patient entered a clinic the last surnameof patients or other factors.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,70,Then starting at thebeginning of the list the initial sample unit israndomly selected from within the ﬁrst k units and thereafter every kth individual is sampled. Typically the integer k is estimated by dividing the size of the target population by the desired samplesize. This method of sampling is easy to implementin practice and the sampling frame can be com piled as the study progresses.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,71,A stratiﬁed random sample divides the popu lation into distinct nonoverlapping subgroups SANGER MARGARET 1064 strata according to some important characteris tics e.g. age income and then a random sampleis selected within each subgroup. The investigatorcan use this method to ensure that each subgroupof interest is represented in the sample.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,72,Thismethod generally produces more precise estimatesof the characteristics of the target population unless very small numbers of units are selectedwithin individual strata. Cluster sampling may be used if the study units form natural groups or if an adequate list ofthe entire population is difﬁcult to compile.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,73,In anational survey for example clusters may com prise individuals in a localized geographic area.The clusters or regions are selected preferably atrandom and the persons are enumerated in eachselected region and random samples are drawnfrom these units of the population. Because sam pling is performed at multiple levels this methodis sometimes referred to as multistage sampling. With nonprobability sampling methods the probability of being included in the sample is unknown.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,74,Examples of this sampling method in clude convenience samples and volunteers. Thesetypes of samples are prone to bias and cannot beassumed to be representative of the target popula tion. For example people who volunteer are fre quently different in many respects from those whodo not. Tests of hypothesis and statistical infer ence concerning the sampled units and the targetpopulation can only be applied with probabilitysampling methods.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,75,That is there is no way toassess the validity of the samples obtained usingnonprobability sampling strategies. VALIDITY AND SOURCES OF ERROR The distribution of values in any sample no mat ter how it is selected will differ from the distribu tion in sample chosen by chance alone. The larger the sample the more likely it is that the sample reﬂects the characteristic of interest in the targetpopulation.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,76,However there are sources of errornot related to sampling that may bias comparisonsbetween the sampled units and the target popula tion. First coverage error selection bias mayarise when the sampling frame does not fully coverthe target population. Second nonresponse biasmay occur when sampled individuals cannot bereached or will not provide the information re quested. Bias is present if respondents differ sys tematically from the individuals who do not re spond.

Today as urban areasgrow more pressure has been put on local watersupplies for the quality of the water that is avail able to a community greatly impacts all aspects ofhealth.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,87,Worldwide 40 percent of the populationdoes not have ready access to clean safe drinkingwater and approximately 60 percent does nothave satisfactory facilities for the safe disposal ofhuman waste. Infectious agents in drinking waterand food cause the diarrheal deaths of severalmillion children annually. In the United States every person uses almost 100 gallons of drinking water per day though onlya small portion of this amount is actually used fordrinking.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,88,Other uses include toilet ﬂushing bath ing cooking cleaning and lawn watering. SOURCES OF WATER Water sources are manifold. Many communities get their water from reservoirs. In 500 B.C.E. the Greeks supplemented local city wells with watersupplied from the mountains as far as ten milesaway. In later times the Romans built aqueductsthat were many miles long there are more thantwo hundred that are still standing in the year2001.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,89,Cities and other communities often providefor their water supply by allocating an open areathat is pristine and protected as a watershed. Thewater is usually of high quality and free fromchemical and microbial contamination. Thesesources are referred to as surface water sourcesand include lakes streams and rivers. Some sur face water requires extensive treatment before itcan be distributed for human consumption.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,90,In other parts of the country water is sup plied to communities from groundwater sourcesthrough deep wells often many thousands of feetdown. Water from these sources is also usuallyfree of chemical and microbial contamination.Groundwater is the main source of drinking water SANITATION 1066for almost half of the population in the United States.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,91,While it is usually free of solids and bacte ria as well as other chemical pollutants it hasoften become contaminated by disposal of liquidwaste and agricultural runoff. Groundwater is rela tively inexpensive but it is limited in volume andirreplaceable if depleted. By providing protec tion to the source either through buffers fromthe reservoirs or by protecting the well head forthe deep wells water is available without muchtreatment.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,92,Because of the increasing population and the increased use of water by each individual in theUnited States there are less uncontaminated wa ter supplies available. Many sources of water mustbe treated prior to consumption. Disinfection is animportant step in the water treatment process todestroy pathogenic bacteria and other harmfulagents. Most water is treated with chlorine as it is avery effective and economical method of treat ment.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,93,An important advantage to using chlorine isthat it has residual properties and continues toprovide germ killing potential as the water travelsfrom the distribution point to the end users. Thereare concerns however about the formation ofdisinfection by products from the reaction of thechlorine with humic substances in the water. Theseby products are referred to as trihalomethanes orTHMs. The most common THM is chloroform which is a carcinogen.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,94,Sanitation includes the appropriate disposal of human and industrial wastes and the protectionof the water sources. Waterborne agents are thecause of many diseases in the United States andelsewhere in the world. These diseases may becaused by bacteria viruses and protozoans. Bacte rial diseases include typhoid shigellosis and chol era. Viral agents cause diseases such as includepolio and hepatitis.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,95,Parasites include the protozoaEntamoeba histolytica and Giardia lambdia which cause amebiasis and giardiasis respectively. Forthe last decade the primary agents in waterbornedisease outbreaks in the United States have beenthe protozoal parasite Giardia and the bacteria Shigella . Another common agent is Cryptosporidium .
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,96,Another example of sanitation as it relates to waterborne diseases globally is schistosomiasis.Schistosomiasis is a chronic debilitating diseasewith signiﬁcant morbidity and mortality that af fects more than 200 million people worldwide.Sanitation and water supply are important issues in an integrated schistosomiasis control program. SANITATION AND WATER POLLUTION Sanitation is directly related to water quality and water pollution.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,97,Water quality usually describesthe level of certain compounds that could presenta health risk. The quality of water is usually de ﬁned by guideline values of what is suitable forhuman consumption and for all usual domesticpurposes including personal hygiene. In relating sanitation to water pollution one must examine both point and nonpoint sourcepollution as these are the two routes of entry of the pollution into the water supply.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,98,Point source pollutants enter the waterways at well deﬁned lo cations such as a pipe or a sewer outﬂow. Thedischarges are usually even and continuous. Indus trial factories sewage treatment plants and stormsewer outﬂows are common point sources of pol lution. Nonpoint sources enter the water systemfrom broad areas of land. It is estimated that 98percent of the bacterial contamination and 73percent of biological oxygen demand are due tononpoint sources.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,99,WASTEWATER Water containing human waste is generally re ferred to as wastewater. In the United States thedisposal of human waste must be handled in asanitary manner. Usually this waste is disposed ofvia a sewer system that uses water as the vehicle forthe disposal. Treatment of wastewater is requiredto prevent pollution of pristine surface waters and groundwater sources. Wastewater treatment con sists of physical chemical and biological proc esses.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,100,In a typical suburban or urban setting wastewater from the home enters a domestic orsanitary sewer system. The sanitary sewer is asystem of pipes that collects the wastewater andthe waste is transported to a wastewater treatmentplant. The water goes through a series of processesthat removes the solids from the water. Solids arecomposted or removed and disposed of via landﬁllor land application as fertilizer.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,101,Sewage consists ofmore than 99.9 percent water by weight and theaverage domestic sewage contains 600 ppm oftotal solids. The amount of solids present in waterhas been one of the major water pollution control SANITATION IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES 1067criteria due to the relationship of the solids to the oxygen demand. Water reuse is an important concept that has only recently gained attention and interest in theUnited States.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,102,Water that is reused commonlyknown as gray water cannot be used on foodcrops or in any type of domestic use. This watercan be used to water landscape and turf. Waterreuse will continue to expand as water resourcesbecome more and more limited. Since approximately 1950 a common method of disposal of solids in the United States has beenthe use of a sanitary landﬁll. The landﬁll whichtypically is located outside a populated area is aplace where wastes are dumped compacted andburied.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,103,Special care in siting the landﬁll must betaken to avoid runoff and leaching of the wastematerials into surface water and groundwater.Landﬁlls that are properly designed with the cor rect engineering and liners can provide adequateprotection. In many locations in the United States these landﬁlls have been sited on marginal landthat was unsuitable for industry or agriculture.Many of these sites are sensitive wetland areas thatserve as habitat for plants and animal species.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,104,The 1974 Safe Drinking Water Act established a set of primary standards to protect human health. These standards consist of maximum contaminant levels for speciﬁc inorganic contaminants volatileorganic chemicals and radioactive materials aswell as limits for turbidity and coliform organisms.Secondary standards are set for temperature color taste and odor.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,105,The Environmental ProtectionAgency has identiﬁed treatment via conventionalcoagulation sedimentation and ﬁltration as effec tive processes in removing or reducing the levelsof contaminants. Societal concerns for the qualityof water resources continue as many streams andcoastal waters do not meet water quality goals.States report that 40 percent of the waters sur veyed are too contaminated for drinking ﬁshing and swimming.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,145,Without adequate con trol of rainwater to mitigate ﬂoods and soil ero sion other sanitation measures can be nulliﬁed.People safe from ﬂoods and mudslides are morewilling to invest in sanitation for their homes andthose in poor tropical urban areas attach a high priority to rainwater drainage. While local com munities can build local drainage downstreamobstructions can cause the backing up of channelsand rivers requiring a watershed wide strategy. Solid Waste Disposal.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,146,The interdependence of sanitation aspects is illustrated by the need foradequate solid waste removal to prevent the block age of rainwater drains. Collection of refuse in hotclimates must be frequent since piles attract ﬂiesand rats and it should rely more on local labor intensive methods rather than on expensive trucks.For the operation to be successful requires closecooperation between the users and providers ofthe service and ﬁnancing must come either frommunicipal recurrent funds and or user fees.

Large sewerage infrastruc ture projects tend to be too expensive for the vastmajority of urban and rural people in developingcountries and it may be impossible to build asewage network infrastructure in congested nar row streets.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,162,SCHISTOSOMIASIS Schistosomiasis also known as bliharzia or bilharziasis is a parasitic infection caused bytrematodes also known as ﬂatworms or ﬂukes ofthe genus Schistosoma . There are many species of animal schistosomes worldwide with ﬁve respon sible for the majority of human infections S. haematobium S. mansoni S. japonicum S. intercalatum and S. mekongi . Schistosomiasis is the second most common human parasitic disease malaria beingthe most common.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,163,The World Health Organization estimates that 600 million people worldwide are at risk of in fection with 200 million already infected. Of these over 120 million have a symptomatic infection.The disease is endemic in over seventy ﬁvecountries. Schistosomes are blood ﬂukes that have two distinct life cycle stages a sexual stage in mammalsand an asexual stage in freshwater snails.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,164,Humansacquire infection when they come into contactwith freshwater lakes and rivers containing infec tive schistosome larvae called cercariae. Cercariaepenetrate the skin migrate through the blood stream and in the case of S .mansoni S. japonicum S. intercalatum and S. mekongi come to rest in the mesenteric venous plexus. S. haematobium cercariae end up in venous plexus surrounding the urinarybladder.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,165,The male and female worms mature into SCHIZOPHRENIA 1075adults and form a permanent mating pair that lives up to ﬁve years. Approximately six weeks after theinitial infection the females begin to producebetween 200 and 3 000 eggs a day depending onthe species. Approximately half of the eggs areexcreted in the urine or stool. If the excreted eggsreach freshwater they hatch into free swimmingmiracidiae that will infect the appropriate snailspecies.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,166,Further development occurs within thesnail and after three to ﬁve weeks a new genera tion of cercariae emerge from the snail ready toinfect other mammalian hosts. Most infections are asymptomatic. In a minor ity of cases a transient illness may occur severalweeks after the initial infection known as Katayamafever characterized by fever cough abdominalpain and diarrhea. Many eggs are not excreted and end up trapped in tissues.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,167,The host s granulomatous inﬂammatoryresponse to these eggs is responsible for most ofthe damage associated with chronic schistosomiasis.S. haematobium eggs which are mainly found around the bladder can result in hematuria ureteric ob struction and bladder cancer. Eggs of the otherspecies usually lodge in mesenteric vessels drain ing to the liver and cause periportal ﬁbrosis withthe subsequent development of portal hyperten sion splenomegaly esophageal varices and pro gressive liver dysfunction.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,168,Eggs in the bowel mu cosa cause ulcerations and polyp formation leadingto diarrhea and abdominal pain. When portalhypertension occurs eggs are shunted to the lungs where pulmonary hypertension may occur. Diagnosis is made by ﬁnding the characteristic eggs in stool or urine. Because eggs may be ex creted intermittently several specimens should beexamined. Occasionally a rectal or bladder biopsymay be necessary.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,169,Serology is the most sensitivediagnostic tool and is particularly useful for detect ing light infections. However the antibody testdoes not distinguish between past and currentinfection so it is not clinically useful in areas ofhigh prevalence where individuals may have beensuccessfully treated and then reinfected. The drug of choice for treatment is praziquantel. Other options include oxamniquinefor treatment of S. mansoni and metrifonate for S. haematobium .
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,170,Treatment may reverse some of the long term sequelae of infection including ﬁbrosis especially in children.Infection control is based on two strategies reduction of transmission and reduction of mor bidity. Reduction of transmission is accomplishedby providing safe water supplies and proper sani tation facilities. Snail eradication is not an ef fective long term strategy.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,171,Much of the focus ofcurrent schistosomiasis control strategies is to mini mize the morbidity caused by the infection throughmass treatment of at risk populations withpraziquantel. This approach also leads to the re duction of egg output and transmission.

SCHIZOPHRENIA Schizophrenia often misunderstood as split per sonality is a chronic mental illness characterizedby psychosis or loss of reality testing.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,174,It is aheterogeneous disease in its presentation course effect on functioning response to treatment and SCHIZOPHRENIA 1076possibly even etiology. In 1990 the total cost of schizophrenia in the United States including men tal health and societal costs was estimated at 32.5billion. The risk of suicide in schizophrenia is atleast 10 percent which is twenty times the risk inthe general population. Over 70 percent of per sons with schizophrenia are unemployed.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,175,An esti mated 30 to 50 percent of the homeless populationhas schizophrenia. As one of the most chronicallydisabling mental illnesses it can be devastating forthose afﬂicted and their families and it has asigniﬁcant impact on public mental health systems. Schizophrenia presents as a syndrome. The symptoms are organized into three major catego ries positive symptoms negative symptoms andcognitive impairment. Positive symptoms includehallucinations delusions thought disorders andbizarre behaviors.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,176,Hallucinations are most com monly auditory usually experienced as voices talk ing to or about the person. Delusions are falsebeliefs and tend to be paranoid grandiose orbizarre in nature. Disorganized speech is presumedto be a manifestation of an underlying thoughtdisorder. The ﬂow of ideas is illogical and mayrange from being mildly confusing to incompre hensible. Words may be strung together basedon sound rather than meaning or entirely newwords may be created.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,177,Bizarre behavior may beobserved as repetitive movements unusual man nerisms odd ways of dressing and disregard forsocial norms. Negative symptoms include ﬂat affect facial expression avolition and apathy. A ﬂat affect isone revealing little emotion or expression. Gener ally persons with schizophrenia seem emotionally disconnected and tend to be socially withdrawn.Avolition and apathy are characterized by a lack ofmotivation and poor grooming and hygiene.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,178,In addition to the positive and negative symptoms ofschizophrenia cognitive impairment with deﬁcitsin attention span memory and information proc essing is often present. Persons with schizophreniaexperience varying constellations and severitiesof symptoms resulting in a range of impairedfunctioning. The prevalence of schizophrenia is approxi mately 0.85 percent of the population worldwideand is fairly consistent across race and geographi cal regions.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,179,Men and women are equally affected.Average age of onset in men is 15 to 25 years ofage while in women it is 25 to 35 years of age. No clear risk factors for developing schizophreniahave been identiﬁed except a family history of thedisease. The disease course is marked by relapses and remissions. Although some persons with schizo phrenia regain their premorbid functioning mostexperience chronic debilitating symptoms.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,180,Acuteonset female gender being married and goodpremorbid adjustment are factors associated witha better prognosis. The etiology of schizophrenia is poorly under stood. Prevailing theories propose a biologicalvulnerability to developing schizophrenia with bothenvironmental and psychological factors contrib uting. The biological vulnerability is likely geneticand is suggested by twin studies adoption studies and an increased rate of schizophrenia in relativesof persons with the disorder.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,181,Immunological ab normalities viral infections and hypoxia have allbeen hypothesized as mechanisms of environmen tal assaults on the developing brain. Pathologi cal theories focus on abnormalities in the neuralcircuitry and in neurotransmitters particularlydopamine. The role of dopamine in schizophreniais supported by studies showing that increaseddopamine activity can induce psychotic symptoms while blocking dopamine receptors can decreasepsychosis.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,182,Schizophrenia is a chronic illness that is man aged not cured. Treatment is most effective whenelements of pharmacotherapy supportive ther apy and psychosocial rehabilitation are integrated.Pharmacotherapy with antipsychotic medications also called neuroleptics is the mainstay of treat ment and is crucial for diminishing the acutesymptoms of schizophrenia as well as maintainingremission. The presumed mechanism of action ofthese medications is blockade of dopamine recep tors in neural tissue.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,183,Due to the severity of symp toms and the functional impairments they pro duce psychosocial supports and rehabilitation areimportant for individuals with schizophrenia andtheir families. Individual supportive therapy andgroup therapy can promote the development ofstrategies to manage psychotic symptoms and tomanage stress which can contribute to relapses.Rehabilitation targets the improvement of voca tional and social skills.

Up to 25 percent of those SCHOOL HEALTH 1077with schizophrenia are too impaired to care for themselves in the community and require residen tial treatment programs or long term hospitaliza tion. Even when a person is able to live in thecommunity brief hospitalizations are often neces sary to treat exacerbations of psychosis.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,186,SCHOOL HEALTH For more than 150 years schools in the United States have addressed the health and safety needsof their students. Prior to the mid 1800s publiceducation was still in a formative state and effortsto introduce health into the schools were isolatedand sparse. In 1840 Rhode Island became theﬁrst state in the nation to require children toattend school and other states adopted compul sory education soon afterwards.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,187,The foundationfor school health programs is often credited toLemuel Shattuck s report in 1850 for the SanitaryCommission of Massachusetts. Among other rec ommendations the report described the valueof using schools to control communicable dis eases. Shattuck s report is applicable to currenthealth problems which often have their etiology in health risk behaviors established during child hood.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,188,According to the report Every child shouldbe taught early in life that to preserve his own life and his own health and the lives and health ofothers is one of the most important and con stantly abiding duties. By the late 1860s the NewYork City Board of Health had established sanitaryinspections for communicable diseases in schools.By the end of the nineteenth century the era of medical inspection in schools became institution alized with school nurses gradually replacing medi cal inspectors.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,189,In 1918 the Commission on the Reorganiza tion of Secondary Education published a land mark report identifying the desired outcomes ofeducation. Health was the ﬁrst of seven cardinaloutcome objectives the other objectives were com mand of fundamental processes worthy homemembership vocation citizenship use of leisure and ethical character.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,190,As a result of the temper ance movement of the late nineteenth and earlytwentieth centuries schools incorporated lessonson the effects of alcohol tobacco and narcoticsinto the hygiene curricula. Physical education wasalso introduced into the school curricula duringthis time period. Between 1918 and 1921 many U.S. states enacted laws requiring health education and physi cal education for school children.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,191,However as aresult of a report issued by the National EducationAssociation and the American Medical Associa tion primary health care services were graduallyreplaced with preventive health care by schoolnurses. This report deﬁned the role of schools inscreening for health problems and referring stu dents with problems to health professionals.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,192,Bythe 1970s there was a reemergence of primaryhealth care in schools with the establishment ofschool based clinics centered around the uniquephysical emotional and developmental needs ofstudents. By 1999 there were over 1 100 school based or school linked health centers in forty ﬁve states. From the early 1900s through the 1980s school health programs had three components healtheducation health services and a healthy schoolenvironment.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,193,In 1987 D. D. Allensworth and L. J.Kolbe proposed an eight component model thatincluded the original three components but addedphysical education nutrition and food services counseling psychological and social services healthpromotion for staff and family and communityinvolvement. Health education consists of a planned se quential K 12 curriculum that addresses the physi cal mental emotional and social dimensions ofhealth.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,194,Health services are provided to students to SCHOOL HEALTH 1078appraise protect and promote health. These ser vices include the provision of emergency and pri mary care access and referral to community healthservices and management of chronic health con ditions. A healthy school environment attends tothe physical and aesthetic surroundings and to apsycho social climate and culture that maximizesthe health of students and staff.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,195,Physical educationis a planned sequential K 12 curriculum thatprovides cognitive content and learning experi ences from a variety of activities that students canenjoy all their lives such as basic movement skills physical ﬁtness rhythms and dance games andsports. School nutrition and food services pro mote the health and education of students throughaccess to a variety of nutritious meals an environ ment that promotes healthful food choices andsupport for nutrition instruction in the classroomand cafeteria.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,196,Counseling psychological and so cial services provide broad based individual andgroup assessments interventions and referralsthat attend to the mental emotional and socialhealth of students. Health promotion for staff provides health assessments health education and health related ﬁtness activities. These programsalso encourage staff to become positive role mod els.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,197,Family and community involvement promotesan integrated school parent and community ap proach that establishes a dynamic partnership toenhance the health and well being of students with schools being encouraged to actively solicitparent involvement and engage community re sources and services.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,198,These eight components interact best when they focus on the behaviors that interfere withlearning and long term well being and when theyfoster support of family friends and community use interdisciplinary and interagency teams to planand coordinate the program use multiple inter vention strategies promote student involvement and provide staff development.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,199,The eight component model forms the basis of a coordinated school health program CSHP currently deﬁned as an integrated set of planned sequential school afﬁliated strategies activities and services designed to promote the optimalphysical emotional social and educational devel opment of students. The program involves and issupportive of families and is determined by thelocal community based on community resources standards and requirements.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,200,It is coordinated by amultidisciplinary team and accountable to the com munity for program quality and effectiveness Allensworth 1997 . While no studies have evaluated the efﬁcacy of the CSHP there have been numerous studies thathave evaluated the components individually andin combination with each other.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,214,Multiple media formats provide oppor tunities to enrich health topics in the classroom byproviding more than one view of an issue and byencouraging thinking. To be effective such for mats must be aligned with focused educationalobjectives. Health education is one important com ponent of the comprehensive school health pro gram that includes the development delivery andevaluation of a planned instructional program andrelated activities for students preschool through12th grade.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,215,Both parents and school staff shouldhave a role in such a program. Media formatscontribute to the understanding and developmentof health knowledge attitudes and skills. Mediaaligned with school health education supportsseveral dimensions of education including curric ula school environment health related services and community based interactions. School based curricula are supported by a variety of media venues including audio visual and electronic formats.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,216,They are selected basedupon speciﬁc objectives relating to knowledgegain attitude change and behavior change. As anexample a video that depicts factual informationabout an infectious disease like chlamydia maywork well if the objective is to impart knowledge.However when the objective is to change atti tudes a medium may be selected which impacts ona person s perceived susceptibility to acquiringchlamydia e.g. an audiotape or video which fea tures interviews with infected peers .
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,217,In addition to addressing established objec tives media selections are also based upon audi ence age level cultural sensitivity accuracy of theinformation duration of the media format andcost. Personal computer PC technology is a me dium that not only supports in class activities butcan also assist in facilitating homework and project development. Some instructors use e mail technol ogy to interact with their students possibly posinga hypothetical problem that needs resolution.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,218,Usingthis approach a dialogue may be established be tween the instructor and the students while theyare in a real world setting e.g. home community school . Media formats can also enhance healthful school environments and services. Developing anenvironment of support can be important in boththe social and psychological dimensions as well asin the physical school setting itself.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,219,Various colors placement of artwork pleasant sounds and offer ing a safe environment for learning all can contrib ute to the development of a positive supportive and learning conducive environment. Timely andwell placed print and electronic announcementsregarding available health services provided by theschool or outside agencies can generate a sense ofcaring. Such approaches also engender a sensethat the school is a valued community resource.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,220,Community based interactions can be en hanced through a careful selection of media for mats. A typical objective is to convey informationto key community members parents agency rep resentatives government ofﬁcials about a majorschool related issue. This may be achieved throughprinted reports that summarize and highlightschool based survey data accomplishments in ac cordance with state regional or national stan dards or other important information.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,221,Curricularrevisions are often presented in printed and audio visual formats. When requested revisions are pre sented in a clear and timely manner it can providea sense of an orderly and consistent approach tochange. It also enables community members toreceive the information in advance of public hear ings or discussions. Complementing the printedmaterial audiovisual formats can help clarify im portant health related issues and trends in theschool and community.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,222,Audiovisual formats canbe enhanced using computer based media whichcan provide clear overviews and examples incor porating static or movement related visuals. School health education plays a vital role not just in education but in improving public healththroughout the community and the nation.

SCREENING Screening is performed to identify the presence of a disease or a risk factor for a disease typicallyamong asymptomatic persons those who do notalready manifest symptoms of disease . In this way a disease or risk factors for a disease can bedetected early allowing either early treatment orprevention including preventing further spreadof communicable or transmissible diseases.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,226,Screen ing tests are widely used by clinicians as part of the periodic health examination as well as by public health ofﬁcials.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,227,Examples of screening tests areas varied as blood tests to detect lead poison ing in young children blood tests to detect thehuman immunodeﬁciency virus HIV measur ing blood pressure to detect high blood pres sure mammography to detect breast cancer sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy to detect can cers of the rectum and colon and questionnairesto identify persons with alcohol or other drugproblems.Table 1 Two By Two Table to Assess the Usefulness of a Screening Test Disease No Disease Positive TestTrue Positive TP False Positive FP Total Positive Negative TestFalse Negative FN True Negative TN Total Negative Total with Disease T otal with No Disease SOURCE Courtesy of author.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,228,Several factors determine the usefulness of a screening test for use with any individual person.The ﬁrst is the accuracy of the test itself speciﬁ cally its sensitivity and speciﬁcity. Sensitivity is theprobability that a person with the disease or riskfactor will test positive. Speciﬁcity is the probabil ity that a person without the disease or risk factorwill test negative. Sensitivity and speciﬁcity areillustrated in Table 1.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,229,The sensitivity of a screeningtest is determined by the number of true positivesdivided by the total number with disease or TP TP FN . The speciﬁcity is the number of true negatives divided by the total number with no disease or TN FP TN . Because there is often some overlap in the distributions of test results among people with andwithout disease i.e.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,230,some people without diseasewill have test results in the disease range and somepeople with disease will have test results in the nodisease range a test s sensitivity and speciﬁcityusually trade off against one another. As the sensi tivity increases the speciﬁcity usually decreases and vice versa.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,231,A screening test that identiﬁesalmost all people with a disease high sensitivity may also produce more false positives among thosepeople without the disease who may have border line results results near the cut off value deﬁnedfor the test .
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,232,Conversely a screening test thatcorrectly identiﬁes almost all people without thedisease high speciﬁcity usually misses more peo ple who truly have the disease false negatives .Tables 2 and 3 represent the characteristics of twohypothetical screening tests when applied to asample of 100 000 people with a true prevalence ofdisease of 10 percent e.g. a relatively commondisease .
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,233,Table 2 is for a test with a sensitivity of 95 SCREENING 1082Table 2 Screening Test with High Sensitivity 95 and Moderate Specificity 65 in a Sample with a 10 True Prevalence of Disease Disease No Disease Positive Test 9 500 31 500 41 000 Negative Test 500 58 500 59 000 10 000 90 000 SOURCE Courtesy of author.Total 100 000 Total percent and a speciﬁcity of 65 percent. Table 3 is for a test with 65 percent sensitivity and 95 percentspeciﬁcity.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,234,The test with high sensitivity Table 2 identiﬁes more people who truly have the diseaseand misses fewer people who truly have the disease false negatives . However this test incorrectlyclassiﬁes more than three people without the dis ease false positives for every one person it cor rectly identiﬁes with the disease. In contrast thetest with high speciﬁcity Table 3 incorrectly clas siﬁes many fewer nondiseased people as havingthe disease false positives but misses more trulydiseased people false negatives .
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,235,In addition to the accuracy of the test itself another important factor is how well the test is implemented. Errors may be introduced that de pend on who is performing the test or on varia tions in the way the test is performed. For exam ple not all radiologists are equally proﬁcient atreading mammograms and not all laboratories willget the same result when measuring cholesterollevels from the same blood sample.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,236,Therefore thetest characteristics that are initially reported for ascreening test often represent a best case scenario the best that a test can be expected to perform. Asa result it is also important to evaluate test accu racy in the real world settings where the tests arebeing used. The usefulness of a screening test also de pends upon the probability that the individualbeing tested has the disease or risk factor of inter est. This is termed the prior probability of dis ease.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,237,This issue is illustrated by comparing Table 2and Table 4.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,238,Table 4 represents the same hypo thetical test shown in Table 2 but applied to aTable 3 Screening Test with Moderate Sensitivity 65 and High Specificity 95 in a Sample with a 10 True Prevalence of Disease Disease No Disease Positive Test 6 500 4 500 11 000 Negative Test 3 500 85 500 89 000 10 000 90 000 SOURCE Courtesy of author.Total Total 100 000 sample in which the true prevalence of disease is less common only 1 percent instead of 10 percent.As shown screening tests are more useful whenthey are used on people who are more likely tohave the disease than people who are less likely tohave the disease.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,239,When a screening test is used in asample with a lower prior probability of disease even more false positives are identiﬁed. In thisexample Table 4 the test has incorrectly identi ﬁed more than 36 people who do not really havethe disease false positives for every one personcorrectly identiﬁed with the disease true positives . Prior probability is taken into account in cal culating the predictive value of a test.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,240,The predic tive value of a positive test is the probability thatsomeone who tests positive truly has the disease.For the examples shown in Tables 2 3 and 4 thepredictive values of a positive test are 23 percent 59 percent and 3 percent respectively. As can beseen the predictive value of a positive test isincreased when tests with higher speciﬁcity areused in samples of people with a higher prevalenceof the disease.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,241,Finally the usefulness of a screening test de pends on the existence of an effective and feasibletreatment. This may include treatment for thedisease or risk factor detected and or an interven tion to prevent further spread of the problem toothers such as removing lead paint from homes orgenetic counseling. If there are no feasible andeffective responses to the results of a screeningtest e.g. the result wouldn t change anything then there is no reason to perform the test.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,242,These issues are of particular concern for screening asymptomatic or healthy people. All SEER PROGRAM 1083Table 4 Screening test with high sensitivity 95 and moderate specificity 65 in a sample with a 1 true prevalence of disease Disease No Disease Positive Test 950 34 650 35 600 Negative Test 50 64 350 64 400 1 000 99 000 SOURCE Courtesy of author.Total Total 100 000 testing involves risks. These risks might be accept able to the small number of persons who turn outto have the disease.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,243,However the risks of side effects from the screening tests themselves orfrom an incorrect or ambiguous diagnosis and thesubsequent testing that an incorrect initial testresult requires may not be acceptable to the muchlarger number of people who do not have thedisease or risk factor of interest. In addition thereare economic costs to screening large numbers ofasymptomatic people to identify a small numberof people with disease.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,244,Therefore clinicians pa tients and public health professionals must weighthe risks and beneﬁts when deciding to use ascreening test for any individual or population.

E DWARDS SEE ALSO Cancer Data Sources and Collection Methods Demography Epidemiology National Insti tutes of Health Vital Statistics SEGREGATION 1084SEGREGATION Segregation is the separation of people based on race religion ethnic group sex or social class. Inthe United States racial segregation has been themost prevalent and visible form. After the aboli tion of slavery in 1865 laws known as Jim Crowlaws were passed in most southern states.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,250,Theterm Jim Crow referred to an African Americancharacter in a popular song composed in the1830s and these laws already introduced afterthat time were designed to enforce racial separa tion.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,251,Segregation was not only enforced by law but also by various forms of physical violence.African Americans were forced to sit only in theback of buses and trains use black only waterfountains and enter through the back doors ofhotels and restaurants if allowed to enter at all.Laws forced blacks to live only in certain sectionsof a town or city be educated in separate schools and obtain health care in separate hospitals orwards. They were also excluded from some gov ernmental jobs.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,252,Segregation not only limited black people physi cally but also economically and socially by block ing access to schooling and jobs. It also served as aform of humiliation and degradation. The SupremeCourt however upheld segregation laws as late as1896 in Plessy v. Ferguson ruling that separate but equal facilities were constitutional.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,253,This conceptwas argued against strongly by both African Ameri cans and whites throughout the United States.Eventually arguments by Thurgood Marshall be fore the Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka in 1954 led the Court to de clare school segregation unconstitutional. Thisstarted a series of legal battles lobbying efforts boycotts and protests which eventually broughtan end to de jure or legal segregation and dis crimination.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,254,Even so de facto segregation orsegregation in fact continues and is evident inhousing education and a number of other areas.Integration remains a continuous process in the United States. The long term impact of years of racial segre gation persists even to this day. African Americanscontinue to live in the sections of cities and townswhere they were initially forced to live and theycontinue to suffer from a lack of economic andeducational opportunities.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,255,The long and difﬁcultexperience of segregation has also resulted indeep mistrust of whites by African Americans. This has at least in part contributed to the notice able disparities in health status and access to healthservices.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,256,In particular African Americans appearto be more hesitant to seek medical attention.There are many potential reasons such as previ ous bad experiences with white health care provi ders as well as the fact that they may not be as aware of their health problems as whites becauseof disparities in the provision of health education.Even after becoming aware of their need for ser vices however African Americans may experi ence many barriers to accessing services i.e. lackof insurance transportation .
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,257,They are also morelikely to obtain inadequate care even after over coming these barriers. These discrepancies areextensively documented in the health services re search literature.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,260,SELF CARE BEHAVIOR Self care behavior a key concept in health promo tion refers to decisions and actions that an indi vidual can take to cope with a health problem or toimprove his or her health. Examples of self carebehaviors include seeking information e.g.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,261,read ing books or pamphlets searching the Internet attending classes joining a self help group exer cising seeing a doctor on a regular basis gettingmore rest lifestyle changes following low fat diets monitoring vital signs and seeking advice throughlay and alternative care networks evaluating thisinformation and making decisions to act or evento do nothing. Self care is generally viewed as acomplement to professional health care for per sons with chronic health conditions.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,262,Self care be havior is however broader than just following adoctor s advice. It also encompasses an individ ual s learning from things that have worked inthe past. Presumed beneﬁts of self care include lower costs for the health care system more effectiveworking relationships between patients and physi cians and other health care providers increasedpatient satisfaction and improved perceptions ofone s health condition.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,263,Self help behaviors havebeen shown to lessen pain and depression and toimprove quality of life. However a relationshipbetween self care behaviors and positive physio logical outcomes has not been proven.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,264,Generally health care practitioners encourage and supportpatients to practice self care behaviors becausepatients then actively participate in their own care.However many practitioners experience difﬁcultyin offering advice on self care behaviors becausethey are not aware of speciﬁc techniques strate gies and supports that patients can use. Within a health promotion context that views health as a resource for daily living self care is seen as empowering.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,265,Through acquisition of self careskills people are able to participate more activelyin fostering their own health and in shaping condi tions that inﬂuence their own health.DEFINITIONS OF SELF CARE No single deﬁnition of self care behavior has been broadly accepted. Deﬁnitions vary as to 1 whoactually engages in self care behavior e.g. individ ual family community 2 what prompts self care behaviors e.g.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,266,to practice health promotion to prevent illness to limit the impact of illness torestore health and 3 the extent to which healthcare professionals are involved. The World Health Organization deﬁnes self care as activities individuals families and com munities undertake with the intention of enhanc ing health preventing disease limiting illness andrestoring health. These activities are derived fromknowledge and skills from the pool of both profes sional and lay experience.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,267,They are undertaken bylay people on their own behalf either separately orin participative collaboration with professionals. Other experts deﬁne self care in terms of individ ual behavior when a person functions on his or herown behalf in health promotion and prevention orin disease detection and treatment. In this deﬁni tion self care behaviors occur without professionalassistance but individuals are informed by techni cal knowledge and skills derived from both profes sional and lay experience.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,268,Still others deﬁne self care as involving activities to enhance health pre vent disease evaluate symptoms and restorehealth either with or without participation byprofessionals. PREVALENCE Studies report that 80 to 95 percent of all health problems are managed at home through self careand that most people who consult a physician havetried treating themselves before seeking medicaladvice.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,269,The seriousness of the health problem andthe extent and type of disability including itsaffect on daily activities are the best determinantsof whether an individual uses self care practices orseeks help from a professional. In one study ofolder persons J. Norburn and colleagues 1995 found that race gender education place of resi dence and socioeconomic status did not signiﬁ cantly inﬂuence the likelihood of self care behav iors.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,270,Persons with chronic health conditions oftenbecome more knowledgeable about their condi tions than the average health care professional and they frequently participate in group or com munity self care educational and support programs. SELF CARE BEHAVIOR 1086HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT Some authors discuss self care as a kind of social movement and not in terms of speciﬁc health related behaviors and activities.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,271,A major inﬂuencein the modern interest in self care developed inthe 1960s with the advent of social movements such as the women s movement and consumerism.Such movements were concerned with issues ofautonomy self determination and independencein both health and illness. A shift from physician dominated health care was catalyzed by the realiza tion that individuals play a large role in directingtheir own health and therefore they should be come more involved in making decisions thataffect their health.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,272,During the following decades several factors contributed to the growth in self care including a shift in patterns of disease fromacute to chronic illnesses a change in emphasisfrom cure to care an increasing discontent withexcessive technology and depersonalized medicalcare a growth in lay knowledge a desire forincreased personal control in interactions withhealth care professionals a need to control escalat ing health care costs an increased level of educa tion and knowledge among the general popula tion a broader dissemination of health relevantinformation a greater emphasis on the rights ofconsumers and an increasing knowledge aboutthe importance of lifestyles for longevity and qual ity of life.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,273,Self care now is concerned with development and use of personal health practices and copingskills making decisions involving consulting oth ers including lay persons and professionals andusing one s own resources to manage healthproblems. Several health care disciplines have achieved consensus on what characterizes self care.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,274,Self care is situation and culture speciﬁc involves thecapacity to act and make choices is inﬂuenced byknowledge skills values motivations control andconﬁdence and it focuses on aspects of healthcare under individual control as opposed to as pects governed by social policy or legislation. THEORETICAL APPROACHES TO SELF CARE In general researchers have relied on existing general theories of behavior change to explainself care.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,275,These major theories include the social learning theory the health belief model the the ory of reasoned action and the transtheoreticalmodel of behavior change. They have met withvarying degrees of success in explaining self carepractices and why some people do or do notengage in these activities.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,276,Two theories are speciﬁc to self care D. E. Orem s theory of self care 1991 which is a con ceptual theory and not empirically derived is spe ciﬁc to managed care environments in which nurs ing interventions occur and the self regulationmodel of self care developed by E. Leventhal H.Leventhal and C. Robitaille. This latter theory has been tested to a limited extent and appears to hold promise in explainingwhy people do or do not engage in self care behav ior.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,277,It posits that an individual s differences andmotivations play a critical role in explaining deci sions to initiate and sustain self care behaviors.The following diagram illustrates the basics ofthis theory. In this model an individual s reality and the emotional reactions to this reality interact. Con currently action plans and procedures for manag ing the symptoms are generated.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,278,Finally there isan appraisal of anticipated and actual outcomes with this feedback possibly leading to changes inemotional reactions and perceptions of reality which in turn lead to changes in action plans andso forth. This theory essentially explains how peo ple represent and manage health threats and howthis changes over time in relation to experiencesand the course of the health threat.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,283,SELF HELP GROUPS The primary focus of self help groups is to provide emotional and practical support and an exchangeof information. Such groups use participatory proc esses to provide opportunities for people to shareknowledge common experiences and problems. Through their participation members help them selves and others by gaining knowledge and infor mation and by obtaining and providing emotionaland practical support.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,284,These groups have beenparticularly useful in helping people with chronichealth conditions and physical and mental disabili ties. Traumatic life events such as death and di vorce are also the basis for groups. Self help groupsare voluntary and they are mostly led by mem bers. Generally groups meet on a regular basis are open to new members and do not cost moneyto join. Traditionally self help groups have beenin person meetings but recently Internet self helpgroups have become popular.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,285,P ATRICK MCGOWAN SEE ALSO Internet Social Networks and Social Support SEMMELWEIS IGNAZ The Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis 1818 1865 graduated in medicine from Viennain 1844.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,286,He then worked in the obstetric wards atthe Allegemeines Krankenhaus in Vienna wherehe was one of a generation of young medicalmen trained by the anatomical pathologist Karlvon Rokitansky who sought to transform tradi tional but ineffective treatment methods by at tacking difﬁcult clinical problems with logic andmathematical precision. Semmelweis was particu larly disturbed by the appalling death rate frompuerperal sepsis or childbed fever.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,287,The germtheory of disease was gaining ascendancy at thattime and Semmelweis reasoned that the women must be acquiring the infection from their medicalattendants. He observed that these attendants ha bitually came direct to the obstetric service from autopsies on women who had died of childbedfever without washing their hands. He initiated arule that required his staff to take particular careto wash their hands with soap and dip their ﬁngersin a bowl of antiseptic solution before attend ing women in labor.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,288,He presented unassailableproof that observing this regimen reduced deathsfrom childbed fever in his wards to near zero.Many senior obstetricians however regarded his SEROLOGIC TEST FOR SYPHILIS 1088ideas as a personal affront and Semmelweis s confrontational style did not help him to win theargument.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,289,The combination of his abrasive per sonality and the hostility of the medical establish ment in Vienna proved too much for him and in1851 he returned to Hungary as a professor ofobstetrics in Budapest where he adopted the samesuccessful methods to reduce the toll of child bed fever. Semmelweis belatedly published his methods and results in 1864. But by then his intellectualpowers were waning perhaps because of mentalillness and he died of septicemia the followingyear.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,290,Semmelweis s method was accepted immedi ately in parts of Bavaria as well as in Hungary andit was developed independently in Boston by Oli ver Wendell Holmes who encountered much thesame hostility and opposition from the Bostonmedical establishment despite also demonstrat ing beyond doubt albeit with less convincing nu merical methods that personal cleanliness by birthattendants could prevent childbed fever.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,291,Only in 1867 when the English surgeon Joseph Lister began using the more cumbersome methodof antiseptic sprays in operating rooms but with out the hand washing at least initially to con trol postoperative infection was the problem ofchildbed fever effectively controlled in the Eng lish speaking world. Had the obstetricians of theUnited States France and Great Britain heededthe evidence offered by Ignaz Semmelweis andOliver Wendell Holmes a whole generation ofyoung women need not have died.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,292,The prob lem of puerperal sepsis seems to have been lessserious in countries where women were not at tended by doctors but supporting facts are scarce.

Serum contains many valuable proteins nucleotides and other chemicals that aid the physio logical functions of the body. Between 1900 and1950 numerous scientiﬁc studies were performedto study the production of serum and its use inmonitoring and controlling diseases.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,294,This periodhas been called the era of International Serology. Serological markers are used to distinguish speciﬁc diseases in individuals. These markers areinvaluable in the detection of some cancers espe cially due to their potential in identifying the earlystages of the disease prior to the onset of symptoms. CRITERIA IN ASSESSING SEROLOGICAL MARKERS Several criteria are used to assess a serological method in a clinical laboratory including sensitiv ity speciﬁcity and predictive value.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,295,Diagnosticsensitivity Se is the ability to correctly identifythose who have a speciﬁc disease and is deﬁned bythe ratio of true positives over true positives andfalse negatives. Diagnostic speciﬁcity Sp is theability of the test to correctly identify those who donot have the disease and is deﬁned by the ratio oftrue negatives over true negatives and false positives.Both of these indexes measure the accuracy ofassays using serological markers relative to anestablished and standard procedure.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,296,The predic tive value Pr contains two components a positivepredictive value Pp and a negative predictivevalue Pn the former describes the likelihoodthat a positive test result represents a true positiveand the later deﬁnes the likelihood that a negativeresult is truly negative. All the above deﬁnitionsare described in Figure 1.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,299,Severalmonoclonal and polyclonal antibodies have beendeveloped for the detection of PSA and about 25to 75 percent of patients with the disease have PSAin their sera. Even with the potential problem oflack of speciﬁcity of the test PSA is the most widelyused tumor associated antigen.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,300,The most commonly used markers for diagno sis and management of epithelial ovarian cancer isCA 125 which is an antigenic determinant part ofa glycoprotein present in the sera of approxi mately 80 percent of patients with epithelial ovar ian cancer. It is found elevated in about 40 percentof patients with Stage I ovarian cancers and about20 percent of patients with mucinous malignan cies. In addition approximately 60 percent ofpancreatic carcinomas express CA 125 as do 25percent of all other solid tumors.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,301,However CA125 is not only a marker for cancer but is alsoelevated in a number of benign gynecologic con ditions including pelvic inﬂammatory disease endometriosis uterine leiomyoma and early preg nancy. This nonspeciﬁcity has limited the use ofCA 125 as a tumor maker in screening and diagnosis.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,302,Carcinoembryonic antigen CEA alpha fetoprotein AFP and altered carbohydrate anti gen 19 9 CA19 9 have been studied in the pastdecade for early diagnosis of human pancreaticadenocarcinoma and gastrointestinal malignancies.The utility of CEA as a serum marker in thedetection of tumors has been limited due to theﬁnding that CEA levels are affected by a variety offactors including liver function biliary obstruc tion and subclinical hepatitis and because theinterlaboratory variation in CEA measurementscould run as high as 36 percent.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,303,AFP was ﬁrst described as a tumor marker for hepatoma in the 1960s. It is most frequently ele vated among patients with hepatoma and yolk sac endodermal sinus tumors. AFP positive tumorscan be found throughout the gastrointestinal tract. CA 19 9 is frequently elevated in pancreatic cancer but is also elevated in cancers of the biliarytract and less frequently in colorectal and gastriccancers.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,304,Studies have shown that CA 19 9 canidentify with reasonable accuracy the majority ofpatients with pancreatic cancer in a highly selectpatient population. The utility of other markers such as pancreatic oncofetal antigen POA andtumor associated trypsin inhibitor TATI is stillbeing studied.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,305,Serological markers have great potential to be used in clinical practice including early detectionof cancer because these markers are differentlyexpressed qualitatively or quantitatively and be cause they vary between either people who arehealthy and those that have certain diseases. How ever sensitivity and speciﬁcity issues remain thecritical challenge when developing new serum mark ers for diagnostic and prognostic purposes.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,308,SEWAGE SYSTEM In the year 2000 it was estimated that 70 percent of the U.S. population lived in areas where domes tic wastes pass through a sewage treatment plantbefore being discharged back into a water source.Sewage treatment systems and chlorination ofwater have made major contributions to the reduc tion of the incidence of waterborne diseases suchas cholera and typhoid fever.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,309,Sewage treatment isused to improve the quality of wastewater so that itcan be released into a waterway without causingdamage to aquatic species or causing waterbornediseases among humans. Several levels of sewagetreatment are used. Primary sewage treatment removes larger ﬂoat ing objects through screening and sedimentation.The incoming wastewater ﬂows through one ormore screens and then enters a grit chamberwhere it slows down enough to allow sand gravel and other inorganic matter to settle out.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,310,In treat ment plants where only primary treatment occurs the efﬂuent is chlorinated and discharged intocirculation in a water source. The sludge or sedi mentation of larger solids is removed dried anddisposed of. Primary treatment removes 50 to 65percent of suspended solids and decreases biologi cal oxygen demand BOD by 25 to 40 percent.Primary treatment alone is not considered ade quate for protection of the environment or peo ple s health.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,311,Secondary treatment relates to processes simi lar to natural biological decomposition. Aerobicbacteria and other microorganisms are used to break down organic materials into inorganic car bon dioxide water and minerals. Trickling ﬁlters which are made from a bed of rocks with a micro bial covering are used to absorb the organic mate rial present in the water. Activated sludge proc esses can be used in place of trickling ﬁlters.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,312,Thelevel of suspended solids and BOD in wastewaterafter primary and secondary treatment has been decreased by 90 to 95 percent. This level of treat ment is not effective in removing viruses heavymetals dissolved minerals or certain chemicals. Tertiary treatment is an advanced level of treatment. This form of treatment can decreasethe level of suspended solids and BOD to approxi mately 1 percent of what was present in the rawsewage prior to primary treatment.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,313,Advanced treat ment processes consist of several biological chemi cal or physical mechanisms. Sewage treatment aims to destroy pathogenic organisms. Since primary and secondary treat ments do not destroy a signiﬁcant number oforganisms chlorination which is effective in kill ing bacteria is used to disinfect treated efﬂuent. Private sewage treatment usually a septic sys tem is constructed on site and is maintained bythe private homeowner.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,314,In this case the septictank holds the solid materials while the water goesto a leach ﬁeld or absorption ﬁeld. The solidsundergo decomposition and on a regular basis generally every three years are pumped from theholding tank. This will vary according to use andcapacity. M ARK G.

SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES 1091SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES Sexually transmitted diseases STDs are caused by a group of infectious microorganisms that aretransmitted mainly through sexual activity. Theseagents represent a costly burdensome global pub lic health problem.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,316,STDs can cause harmful oftenirreversible clinical complications including re productive health problems fetal and perinatalhealth problems and cancer and they are alsolinked in a causal chain of events to the sexualtransmission of human immunodeﬁciency virus HIV infection.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,317,Although STDs are largely pre ventable through behavior modiﬁcation and soundprimary health care they are under recognized and under appreciated as a public health problemby most healthcare providers the general public and healthcare policy makers. In 1997 the Insti tute of Medicine characterized STDs as hiddenepidemics of tremendous health and economicconsequence in the United States and advocatedurgent national preventive action. An estimated 333 million curable STDs occur annually worldwide.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,318,In the United States STDsare among the most frequently reported infec tious diseases nationwide. Each year an estimated15 million new cases of STDs occur in Americans including nearly 4 million infections in U.S. teen agers. The annual direct and indirect costs of theprincipal STDs including sexually transmitted HIVinfection and their complications are estimated at 17 billion. More than twenty ﬁve bacteria viruses pro tozoa and yeasts are considered sexually trans missible.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,319,Bacterial STDs include those caused byChlamydia trachomatis chlamydia Neisseria gonor rhoeae gonorrhea Treponema pallidum syphilis Haemophilus ducreyi chancroid and other com mon sexually transmitted organisms. Chlamydiaand gonorrhea cause inﬂammatory reactions inthe host. In women these organisms can ascendinto the upper reproductive tract where pelvicinﬂammatory disease PID can cause irreparable damage to the reproductive organs and result in infertility ectopic pregnancy and chronic pelvicpain.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,320,In its early stages syphilis causes painlessgenital ulcers and other infectious lesions. Leftuntreated syphilis moves through the body instages damaging many organs over time. Chan croid is associated with painful genital lesions. Inpregnant women acute bacterial STDs can cause potentially fatal congenital infections or perinatalcomplications such as eye and lung infections inthe newborn. Effective single dose antimicrobialscan cure chlamydia gonorrhea syphilis andchancroid.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,321,Viral STDs include the sexually transmitted viral infections caused by human immunodeﬁ ciency virus HIV infection herpes simplex virustype 2 genital herpes and human papillomavirus HPV infection . Initial infections with these or ganisms may be asymptomatic or cause only mildsymptoms. Treatable but not curable viral STDsappear to be lifelong infections. HIV is the virusthat causes acquired immunodeﬁciency syndrome AIDS . Herpes causes periodic outbreaks of pain ful genital lesions.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,322,Some strains of HPV causegenital warts and others are important risk factorsfor cervical dysplasia and invasive cervical cancer.Hepatitis B virus HBV is another acute viralillness that can be transmitted through sexualactivity. Most persons who acquire HBV infectionrecover and have no complications but it cansometimes become a chronic health problem. Trichomonas vaginalis trichomoniasis is a com mon protozoal STD and Candida species candidia sis are sexually transmitted yeasts.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,323,Both are fre quently associated with vaginal discharge. BIOLOGICAL FACTORS IN THE SPREAD OF STDS STDs are behavior linked diseases that result from unprotected sex. Nonetheless several biologicalfactors contribute to their spread. These includethe asymptomatic nature of STDs the long lagtime between infections and complications thehigher susceptibility of women to STDs and theway that STDs facilitate the transmission of HIV infection. The silent nature of STDs represents their greatest public health threat.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,324,Most STDs causesome symptomatic illness but many produce symp toms so mild or nonspeciﬁc that infected personsare not alerted to seek medical care. As many asone in three men and two in three women withchlamydia infection have no obvious signs of infec tion. Without treatment or other interventions SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES 1092infected persons can continue to infect new sex partners. Moreover serious complications thatcause irreversible damage can occur silently be fore any symptoms are apparent.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,325,A related prob lem is the long interval that can elapse betweenacquiring an STD and recognizing a clinically sig niﬁcant health problem. Women can develop cer vical cancer many years after infection with somestrains of HPV. A woman may ﬁrst suspect she had an asymptomatic infection with chlamydia or gon orrhea when she ﬁnds out later in life that she isinfertile or has an ectopic pregnancy.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,326,Because theoriginal infection was likely to have been asympto matic there is frequently no perceived connectionbetween the original sexually acquired infectionand the resulting health problem. The lack ofawareness of this connection leads people to un derestimate their risk and to forego preventiveprecautions. Gender and age are also associated with in creased risk for STDs. Women are at higher riskthan men for most STDs and young women aremore susceptible to certain infections than olderwomen.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,327,Due to cervical ectopy that is extremelycommon in adolescent females the immature cer vix of adolescent females is covered with cells thatare especially susceptible to STDs such as chlamydia. The presence of other STDs especially those that cause genital ulcers or inﬂammation inﬂu ences the sexual transmission and acquisition ofHIV infection. Studies have repeatedly demon strated that people are two to ﬁve times morelikely to become infected with HIV through sexualcontact when other STDs are present.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,328,In addition dually infected persons persons who are infectedwith both HIV and another STD are more likelyto transmit HIV infection during sexual contact.Conversely effective STD detection and treatmentcan slow the spread of HIV infection at the individ ual and community levels.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,329,For example in a studyin Malawi in the mid 1990s treatment of gonor rhea in HIV infected men returned the frequency and concentration of HIV genetic material in se men to levels comparable to levels found in HIV infected men who were not infected with otherSTDs.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,330,Similarly a community trial in Tanzania in the mid 1990s demonstrated that treatment ofsymptomatic STDs resulted in a 42 percent de crease in new heterosexually transmitted HIVinfections.SOCIAL FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE SPREAD OF STDS Some social factors directly affect STD spread especially in vulnerable populations. In addition the stigma that continues to surround STDs in theUnited States indirectly interferes with establish ing new social norms pertaining to sex and sexuality.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,331,When there are barriers to health care it is difﬁcult to detect and treat STDs early. Infectedpersons also miss an opportunity for behavioralchange counseling. Health care access barrierskeep infected persons in the community wherethey continue to spread STDs. In the United States groups with the highest rates of STDs are the samegroups in which access to health care services islimited or absent.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,332,Perhaps the greatest social factor contributing to the spread of STDs and the factor that mostsigniﬁcantly separates the United States from in dustrialized countries with low STD rates is thestigma that continues to be associated with sexu ally transmitted infections. Although sex and sexu ality pervade many aspects of American culture most Americans are secretive and private abouttheir sexual behavior. Talking openly and comfort ably about sex and sexuality is difﬁcult even inintimate relationships.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,333,This secrecy about sexual ity and STDs adversely affects STD prevention inthe United States by thwarting sexuality and STDeducation programs for adolescents hinderingcommunication between parents and children andbetween sex partners promoting unbalanced sex ual messages in the media obstructing educationand counseling activities and impeding researchon sexual behaviors.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,334,GROUPS DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY STDS All racial cultural economic and religious groups are affected by STDs and people in all communi ties and sexual networks are at risk. Nevertheless some persons are disproportionately affected bySTDs and their complications.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,335,STDs disproportionately affect disenfranchised persons and individuals who are in social networkscharacterized by high risk sexual behaviors sub stance abuse and limited access to health care.Some notable disproportionately affected groups SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES 1093include sex workers homeless persons and runa ways adolescents and adults in detention andmigrant workers. Many studies document the asso ciation of substance use especially alcohol anddrug use with STDs.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,336,The introduction of illicitsubstances into communities can dramatically al ter sexual behavior in high risk sexual networksleading to epidemic spread of STDs. The nationalU.S. syphilis epidemic of the late 1980s was fueledby the effect of increased crack cocaine use espe cially in minority communities.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,337,Crack cocaine ledto increases in sex exchanged for drugs and in thenumber of anonymous sex partners and decreasedhealth care seeking behavior and motivation to use barrier protection all factors that can in crease STD transmission in a community. Othersubstances including alcohol can also affect aperson s cognitive and negotiating skills beforeand during sex lowering the likelihood that pre ventive action will be taken to protect against STDsand pregnancy.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,338,Gender disparities are an important aspect of the epidemiology of STDs. Compared to men women suffer more frequent and serious STDcomplications including PID ectopic pregnancy infertility and chronic pelvic pain. Women arebiologically more susceptible to infection whenexposed to a sexually transmitted agent and STDsare often more easily transmitted from a man to awoman than from a woman to a man.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,339,Given thatsome newly acquired STDs and even some long term complications are only mildly symptomaticor completely asymptomatic in women the combi nation of increased susceptibility and silent infec tion frequently results in delayed STD diagnosisand treatment. A further complication is that STDsare more difﬁcult to diagnose in women due to thecomplex anatomy of the female reproductive tractand the frequent need for a speculum examina tion and diagnostic culture tests.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,340,In pregnant women STDs can result in seri ous health problems or death to a developing fetusor newborn. Sexually transmitted pathogens canbe transmitted across the placenta resulting incongenital infection or can reach the newbornduring vaginal childbirth resulting in perinatalinfection. Regardless of the route of infection these organisms can permanently damage the fetalor newborn brain spinal cord eyes auditory nerves or immune system.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,341,Even when the organisms donot reach the fetus or newborn directly they cancause spontaneous abortion stillbirth premature rupture of the membranes and preterm delivery. For a variety of behavioral social and biologi cal reasons STDs also disproportionately affectadolescents. In 1998 U.S. teenagers 15 to 19 yearsold had the highest reported rate of chlamydia andthe second highest rate of gonorrhea.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,342,The herpesinfection rate among white youth in the UnitedStates aged twelve to nineteen increased nearlyﬁvefold from the late 1970s to the early 1990s.Because not all teenagers are sexually active theactual rate of STDs among teens is even higherthan the observed rates suggest. There are severalcontributing factors. Many teenagers are in fact sexually active and at risk for STDs and they arehaving sex with partners from sexual networksthat are already highly infected with untreatedSTDs.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,343,In 1999 among U.S. high school youthinterviewed for the Youth Risk Behavior Surveil lance System survey half 49.9 indicated theyhad had sexual intercourse during their lifetimes.Early sexual activity and multiple sexual partnerswere commonly reported among American highschool youth 8.3 percent of students indicatedthey had ﬁrst had sex before age thirteen and 16.2percent said they had four or more sex partnersduring their lifetime.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,344,Despite the supposedly easyaccess to condoms that can lower STD transmis sion risk considerably only 58 percent of sexuallyactive students said they used a condom the lasttime they had intercourse. Sexually active teenag ers are often reluctant to seek STD services or faceserious obstacles to obtaining such services. Inaddition health care providers are often uncom fortable discussing sexuality and risk reductionwith young persons.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,345,Some minority racial and ethnic groups mainly black and Hispanic populations in the UnitedStates have higher rates of STDs compared withrates for whites.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,346,Race and ethnicity in the UnitedStates are risk markers that correlate with othermore fundamental determinants of health statussuch as poverty access to quality health care health care seeking behavior illicit drug use andliving in communities with high STD prevalence.Public health data may over represent STDs amongracial and ethnic groups who are more likely toreceive STD services from public sector STD clin ics characterized by timely and complete reportingof public health statistics.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,347,However even whenrandom sampling techniques are used to study SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES 1094health problems higher rates of STDs are often found among African Americans and Hispanicscompared with whites. FACTORS IMPORTANT TO THE PREVENTION AND CONTROL OF STDS The dynamics of how STDs spread in populations have been studied extensively to derive approachesto prevention and control.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,348,Three main factorspredict how fast and at what level STDs will spreadin a population the nature of sexual relationships the degree to which susceptibility to STDs can bemodiﬁed and the timeliness and completeness oftreatment. The nature of sexual relationships refers to the decisions people make about when to becomeand remain sexually active and whom to select assex partners.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,349,The earlier that vaginal oral or analsexual intercourse begins and the greater the num ber of lifetime sex partners the more likely aperson is to acquire one or more STDs in a life time. Behavioral interventions that help delay theinitiation of intercourse and reduce the lifetimenumber of sex partners will have a positive effecton slowing STD transmission. Susceptibility to STDs can be modiﬁed with vaccines or barrier contraceptives such as con doms.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,350,If uninfected persons are somehow im mune to STDs then no transmission will occur.The availability of effective vaccines against STDscould dramatically slow increases in or even elimi nate some STDs. For example there is an effectiveand widely available vaccine for hepatitis B a viralSTD. Current strategies to immunize all childrenagainst hepatitis B before they become sexuallyactive could greatly reduce the societal burden ofthis disease. Susceptibility can also be altered eachtime sex occurs.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,351,The correct and consistent use ofcondoms can reduce the rate of STD transmissionin a population. Persons who choose to engage insexual behaviors that place them at risk of STDsshould use latex or polyurethane condoms everytime they have sex. A condom put on the penisbefore starting sex and worn until the penis iswithdrawn can help protect both the male and thefemale partner from most STDs. When a malecondom cannot be used appropriately sex part ners should consider using a female condom.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,352,How ever condoms do not provide complete protec tion from all STDs. Sores and lesions of STDs oninfected men and women may be present in areas not covered by the condom resulting in transmis sion of infection to a new person. This is commonwith genital warts and other genital HPV infections.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,353,Although condom use has been on the rise in the United States over the past few decades womenwho use the most effective forms of contraception sterilization and hormonal contraception are lesslikely than other women to use condoms for STDprevention. The most effective methods of contra ception are not the most effective methods of STDprevention likewise methods that give a consider able measure of protection against STDs are con sidered to be good but not the most effective methods of pregnancy prevention.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,354,This suggeststhat especially for young women who are at high est risk for unwanted pregnancy and STDs usingdual protection condoms and hormonal contra ception will offer the best overall protectionagainst both. The third factor in STD prevention and con trol focuses on ﬁnding and treating infected per sons and their sex partners. The longer someonehas an untreated STD especially if the person isasymptomatic the longer that person can poten tially infect others.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,355,If that interval can be short ened for the millions of persons who acquire STDseach year then transmission would slow apprecia bly. Screening and treatment are the biomedicalapproaches that can be applied to this situation.For STDs that are frequently asymptomatic screen ing and treatment also beneﬁt those likely to suffersevere complications especially women if infec tions are not detected and treated early.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,356,For exam ple in the early 1990s chlamydia screening in alarge metropolitan managed care organization re duced the incidence of subsequent PID in thescreened group by 40 percent. Identifying andtreating partners of persons with curable STDs hasalways been an integral part of organized controlprograms. Theoretically this can break the chainof transmission in a sexual network.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,357,Early antibi otic treatment of a sex partner can interfere withan STD taking hold in a recently exposed person.Partner treatment beneﬁts the original patient byreducing the risk of reinfection and the partnerbeneﬁts by avoiding acute infection and potentialcomplications. Because future sex partners areprotected by treating partners this strategy also SHAMANIC HEALING 1095beneﬁts the community.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,358,New screening tests some of which can be performed on urine specimens that facilitate STD screening in nontraditional set tings are now available. Many examples demonstrate the effectiveness of organized approaches to STD prevention andcontrol that incorporate these strategies on a largescale. When a sustained collaborative multifacetedapproach to STD prevention and control is under taken dramatic results can be achieved.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,359,One needonly observe the results of sustained STD preven tion efforts in many countries in Western andNorthern Europe Canada Japan and Australia where STD rates are many times lower than in theUnited States to conclude that STD preventionprograms can work on a national scale.

Shattuckgrew up in a small farming community in NewHampshire where at the age of nineteen a relig ious revival movement inspired him to dedicatehis life to improving society. He came to believethat he could enhance the ability of government torespond to social ills through the collection ofstatistics. After relocating several times through out New England Shattuck settled in Concord Massachusetts in 1823.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,380,There in 1835 he gainedattention for writing A History of the Town of Con cord which included a statistical analysis based on church and municipal records. Shattuck was alsoresponsible for Concord s new code of schoolregulations which was based on a method he devised to evaluate the progress of every student in the town. In 1835 Shattuck moved to Boston where he became a bookseller and helped form the Ameri can Statistical Association.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,381,After being elected tothe Boston City Council in 1837 Shattuck wasasked to create a report analyzing Boston s vitalstatistics from 1810 to 1841. In addition to hisﬁndings which were published in the American Journal of Medical Sciences Shattuck outlined a method for the systematic gathering of vital statis tics and a plan for analyzing that data. Based on hissuggestions Massachusetts passed the Registra tion Act of 1842.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,382,Shattuck was also renowned for his 1850 sur vey of sanitary conditions throughout the state the Report of the Sanitary Conditions of Massachusetts which was commissioned by the state legislature.In this report Shattuck proposed the creation of apermanent statewide public health infrastructure and he recommended establishing health ofﬁcesat the state and local levels in order to gatherstatistical information on public health conditions.Although the legislature did not adopt his compre hensive plan his speciﬁc proposals became rou tine public health activities over the course of thetwentieth century.

SHIGELLOSIS Shigellosis also known as bacillary dysentery is a common food borne infection that causes diar rhea with fever toxemia and general prostration.Blood and mucous are often mixed with the loose watery stools indicating severe inﬂammation ofthe intestinal lining. The causative organisms areseveral varieties of the genus Shigella . Infection is transmitted by active or convalescent cases e.g. person to person .
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,385,Food handlers working inunhygienic kitchens or restaurants sometimes be come the index case for large epidemics. Theincubation period is short from one to three days so it can be relatively easy to trace the source of anoutbreak.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,386,The diarrhea and other symptoms usu ally run their course in a week or so but theinfectious agents can persist in feces for severalweeks which is the reason that food handlers SHINGLES 1098should not be allowed to return to work prefer ably for several weeks or until stool examinationsfor Shigella organisms are negative.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,387,Control of shigella dysentery can be difﬁcult especially in settings such as military campaigns.Meticulous hygiene in all aspects of food handlingand meal preparation are essential everyone inthe kitchen must scrupulously observe the rulesfor hand washing with warm water and soap aftervisiting the toilet and before handling food.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,390,Symptoms typically include fa tigue cognitive complaints headache shortnessof breath irritation of the nose oropharynx andeyes rashes and complaints of unpleasant odor inthe workplace. It is critical to distinguish SBS frombuilding related illness which refers to conditionsmore readily diagnosable by practitioners and char acterized by abnormal signs.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,391,These include carbonmonoxide poisoning asthma hypersensitivity pneumonitis and upper respiratory infections.The symptoms and paucity of signs that character ize SBS overlap substantially with the symptoms ofvarious other medically unexplained syndromessuch as chronic fatigue syndrome ﬁbromyalgia multiple chemical sensitivities and even psychiat ric conditions characterized by somatic symptoms.The key is that with SBS the symptoms wax andwane with exposure to a particular building envi ronment.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,392,Sorting out their diverse causal inﬂu ences is the key to prevention and involves inte gration across many ﬁelds. A number of factors have been identiﬁed in experimental and ﬁeld studies which contrib ute to SBS although there remains much uncer tainty about speciﬁcs of exposure dose suscepti bility and in particular the development of chronicsymptoms once an afﬂicted individual is removedfrom a building exposure.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,393,Strong observationalepidemiologic data has shown relatively high ratesof symptoms in ofﬁce workers in a variety ofcountries and climates. At least 20 to 35 percent ofworkers report such symptoms even in nonproblembuildings. One important clue to SBS is that ratesof symptoms are strongly correlated with mechani cal ventilation systems as opposed to natural venti lation. Elevated carbon dioxide levels are a markerfor inadequate ventilation but are not toxic perse.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,394,Relative humidity below 20 percent and above60 percent are correlated with mucous membrane discomfort or general symptoms. It is clear from controlled exposure studies as well as observational studies that even rela tively low levels of volatile organic compounds VOCs can acutely produce many of the symp toms of SBS and that these symptoms remit onceexposure is terminated. Attempts to documentobjective correlates of these symptoms withneuropsychological or respiratory tests have notbeen very successful.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,395,VOCs are emitted from manyconstruction materials as well as ofﬁce products and while most noticeable with new buildings many emission sources are chronic. VOCs can alsobe reintroduced during building maintenance andrenovation as well as normal business activities. A number of studies document an increased rate of symptoms independent of allergy in build ings with moisture problems and or documented SICKLE CELL DISEASE 1099bacterial and mold growth.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,396,Atopy the tendency to be allergic is a risk factor for symptoms per haps due to allergies to bacteria and fungi. Muchwork remains to be done in sorting out whetherthose reporting symptoms have a speciﬁc building related illness e.g. asthma rhino sinusitis inter stitial lung disease as opposed to SBS.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,397,Reports ofsystemic disease and immune system damage frommycotoxins also requires further study and veriﬁ cation but there is compelling preventive logic totaking steps to avoid excessive moisture in build ings and to responding promptly when it occurs toreduce microbial growth. Workplace stress can contribute to symptoms according to numerous studies. The mechanismand degree of interaction of SBS with physicalfactors needs further study.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,398,Individual psychologi cal characteristics can certainly inﬂuence who re ports symptoms and the degree of distress associ ated with a given level of symptoms. Nevertheless the strong ability of environmental factors to trig ger symptoms means that preventive or ameliora tive strategies aimed solely at workplace stress orpersonal characteristics will not be satisfactoryover the long run.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,402,In sickle cell disease a mutation of thebeta globin gene results in the substitution of valinefor glutamic acid in the sixth amino acid of thechain producing a hemoglobin designated hemo globin S that has less solubility than does normalhemoglobin A. Inheriting one gene for hemoglo bin S together with a normal gene results in theformation of red cells that contain approximately40 percent of the abnormal hemoglobin and 60percent of the normal hemoglobin an essentiallyharmless state that is designated as sickle cell trait.But if the gene inherited together with the sicklegene is not normal then the sickle cell disease maydevelop.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,403,The most common hemoglobin that in teracts with sickle hemoglobin is hemoglobin C and the ß thalassemia beta thalassemia mutationalso interacts with the sickle gene by restricting theformation of normal hemoglobin. The sickle gene and genes that interact with it are common in a number of different popula tions but the highest gene frequencies are ob served in Africa. The gene is also found in south ern Europe the Middle East and India. A singledose of the sickle gene provides protection againstmalaria.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,404,Since malaria was a major cause of deathin Africa persons who carried the sickle gene hada survival advantage over those who did not. Thus the number of persons carrying this mutation hastended to increase generation after generation inareas where malaria was a major killer. AmongAfrican Americans approximately 7.8 percent arecarriers of the sickle mutation that is they havesickle cell trait while 2.3 percent have hemoglobinC trait one copy of the hemoglobin C gene and0.8 percent have ß thalassemia trait.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,405,Although a single copy of the hemoglobin S gene is quite harmless if a person inherits twocopies of the hemoglobin S genes he or she willhave sickle cell disease. If one hemoglobin S geneand one hemoglobin C gene are inherited thepatient has hemoglobin S C disease.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,406,Patients with thesethree disorders have a similar clinical disease.Anemia occurs as a result of the rapid destructionof red blood cells. The red cells may have the shapeof sickles hence the term sickle cell disease. However the cells may assume may other forms.The misshapen red cells occlude blood vessels andcause pain and even tissue death. In small children one of the great problems incident to sickle cell disease is infections.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,407,If theseare treated promptly most children with sickle celldisease survive into adult life. One of the mostcharacteristic manifestations of the disease in adultsand older children is pain crises. These occur atregular intervals often at a time of stress and maycause frequent hospitalizations and varying de grees of dependence upon pain killing drugs. Aspatients with the sickle cell disease grow older theybegin to suffer from the results of accumulateddamage in small blood vessels all through thebody.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,408,Dysfunction of the lungs kidneys and heartare common. Strokes may occur. Interruption ofthe blood supply to bones may result in areas ofbone death particularly in the hips. Although sickle cell disease is a disorder that has been better understood and studied in moredetail than most other disorders treatment is stillvery unsatisfactory. Prenatal diagnosis can be car ried out quite easily and very reliably and parentsare provided with the option of terminating thepregnancy.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,409,Antibiotics and immunization programshave drastically reduced the mortality rate amongyoung children. Transfusion of red blood cellsimproves the ﬂow properties of blood and mayameliorate the symptoms. Hydroxyurea has beenadministered to increase the amount of fetal he moglobin a hemoglobin that does not interactwith sickle hemoglobin. This treatment has metwith some success.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,410,The disease is cured by bone marrow trans plantation a procedure with a relatively high risk even in those patients in whom a match can befound. Ultimately the disease may be treated byputting a normal beta globin gene into a stem cellof the patient and then transplanting that patientwith his or her own transduced cells but there aremany barriers to implementing such a strategy.Because stem cells do not divide often they arerelatively resistant to many gene transfer methods.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,411,It is not enough to put a normal globin gene in thecell the abnormal globin gene needs to be inacti vated. There is also a tendency for normal humancells to shut off the function of foreign genes thatare implanted in them. It is likely that these techni cal obstacles to gene therapy will be overcomeeventually and that the treatment of this group ofdiseases will give better results in the future.

It remainsdifﬁcult however to know the historical inﬂu ences that prompted the early use of tobacco.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,433,It isknown that smoking developed social signiﬁcance SMOKING BEHAVIOR 1103through tribal ceremonies and customs of the indigenous populations of North America. As in dustrial societies became established mass pro duction and corporate marketing took advantageof the stimulative and addictive properties of nico tine. The use of tobacco also took on a new socialmeanings as it was marketed to fulﬁll psychosocialneeds such as a attaining independence or beingpart of a cool trend.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,434,The result was widespread and frequent usage particularly through the smok ing of cigarettes. High consumption has sinceproduced devastating health effects. Although earlyopponents had to rely primarily on moral andemotional persuasion epidemiological evidenceof tobacco s impact on morbidity and mortalitynow provides the principal impetus to developpolicies to prevent smoking.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,435,The abundance of information that now exists on smoking necessitates the use of various frame works theories and models in order to achieve acomprehensive and coherent perspective. A framework such as PRECEDE PROCEED helps depictthe broad context of smoking and encourages theanalysis of a comprehensive range of variables atheoretical approach facilitates explanations as wellas predictions and modeling enhances visual rep resentation or mathematical relations.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,436,Most of themajor public health models and theories havebeen applied to smoking and the literature con tains support for many of these theories. This ispartly due to the generality of the theoreticalconcepts. Figure 1 is a graph of the prevalence of smok ing across age groups in Canada. This graph showsthat daily smoking largely begins and expandsduring the teenage years and then peaks amongyoung adults before decreasing.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,437,The behavior fol lows a sequence of experimentation initiation maintenance and cessation. While the major be havioral change occurs during the teenage years many of the predisposing factors develop at anearlier age.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,439,Due to the increasingly com plex nature of society the early socialization proc ess needs to build capacities for communication learning and making decisions for healthful be havior. The initiation of smoking tends to existamong young people who report having a homeenvironment that includes difﬁculty communicat ing with parents lack of parental understanding low levels of trust and a generally unhappy homelife.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,440,This type of family setting creates conditionsconducive to a lifestyle that includes smoking.Such predisposing factors are also evident as socialnetworks expand during the teenage years. The teenage years are a time of transition. They form a bridge between the relatively shel tered environment of childhood and the roles ofadulthood. Teenagers begin to conﬁrm their ownidentities and emulate adult roles.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,441,There is a height ened awareness of role models and a tendency toestablish boundaries through experimentation andexperiencing new risks. School is obviously animportant environment for teenagers and studentswho smoke at this age are more likely to experi ence difﬁculties in the academic setting.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,442,Theyexperience lower grades poor student teacher in teractions minimal academic aspirations for thefuture and often complain of unfair school rules.Teenage smokers also tend to have lower self esteem they are more likely to report feelings ofunhappiness and loneliness a lack of conﬁdence and a sense of being unhealthy. SMOKING BEHAVIOR 1104Young people who smoke generally have a reduced capacity to implement practices that pro mote advancement at home and at school and inother important settings.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,443,This can affect theirability to maintain a healthy sense of identity thatincludes belonging worthiness and hope for thefuture. Tobacco advertisements prey on these needsby offering an image of suave independence. Theinsinuation is that smoking will help an individualto achieve desirable qualities. Data are not readilyavailable to quantify the behavioral impact of thispractice. It has been shown however that youngpeople are readily able to identify images andbrands promoted by the tobacco industry.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,444,Other aspects of the social environment have promoted the acceptability of smoking such as smoking by role models in the movie industry and the widespread visibility of smoking. Studies indi cate that smokers tend to overestimate the preva lence of smoking and underestimate the healthhazards. All these processes and conditions are setin place during the early years of socialization andthey contribute toward a predisposition that smok ing is acceptable and even desirable.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,445,Once indi viduals are predisposed toward the possibility ofsmoking enabling factors facilitate the actualbehavior. ENABLING FACTORS Two obvious requirements are necessary for some one to smoke being able to acquire cigarettes andhaving a setting that is conductive to lighting up.Increased access to a supply of cigarettes is closelyrelated to the expansion of a person s boundariesand social networks. Peer groups create an impor tant source and setting for the uptake and mainte nance of smoking.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,446,During their midteens smok ers tend to have a larger number of friends andspend a great deal of time with them outside ofschool activities. Friends and relatives often supplycigarettes to begin smoking but commercial out lets quickly become the main source. Studies havefound that young people do not have difﬁcultyobtaining tobacco even with recent legislation toprevent the sale of tobacco to minors.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,447,When prices are increased largely through taxation additional sources become important.These include roll your own tobacco illegal smug gling tax free sales on Indian reservations andmail order. The inverse relationship between priceand consumption may be because smoking is more prevalent among persons with a lower socioeco nomic status who have a limited amount of moneyto spend on tobacco products.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,448,However oncesmoking has begun there is a tendency towardcontinuance and an integration of smoking intoone s lifestyle. The predisposing and enabling fac tors develop into patterns that reinforce the be havior as do the addictive properties of nicotine. REINFORCING BEHAVIOR PATTERNS Reinforcing patterns begin with having friends who are smokers. Spending time with such friendsprovides ample opportunities to reinforce smok ing behavior.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,449,Patterns develop to have a cigaretteduring breaks at work with food and beverages and during social events such as parties. Strongcorrelations exist between smoking and the con sumption of caffeine alcohol and marijuana. Thesepatterns move smokers away from healthy andproductive lifestyles. There are thus a host ofillness symptoms and premature deaths attribut able directly to smoking as well as indirectly to thebroader pattern of unhealthful behavior.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,450,In 1999 The World Health Organization re ported that the joint probability of trying smok ing becoming addicted and dying prematurely ishigher than for any other addiction. Althoughsmokers downplay the consequences of smoking they do recognize that a risk exists though theyﬁnd it difﬁcult to quit. Many teenagers believe theywill only smoke for a short duration. Others statethey can quit anytime. Unfortunately a signiﬁ cant number are in for a long struggle and per haps a lifetime addiction to tobacco.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,451,Most of thedecline in the proportion of smokers does notoccur until past the age of forty. This is partiallyrelated to successful quitters and premature deathsof smokers. More than two out of three adultsmokers report a desire to quit smoking. The mostcommon reason for successful quitting is a con cern about future health.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,452,The inﬂuence of thesehealth concerns is enhanced by a continual declinein the proportion of adult smokers subsequent tothe publication of the 1964 Surgeon General sreport outlining the consequences of smoking.However during the 1990s there was a slightlyupward trend in the proportion of high schoolstudents who are smoking. For young people the SMOKING CESSATION 1105subjective meaning of smoking extends beyond the concern about future health consequences.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,453,The principal predisposing and enabling fac tors for smoking occur during the socializationprocess. Personal insecurities problems at home and difﬁculties in academic environment are allpreyed upon by a tobacco industry driven by prof its and smoking cigarettes and intake of nicotinebecome entrenched into behavioral patterns thatcreate a high risk trajectory and bleak outlook forthe health of individuals and the population.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,454,Theunderlying causes of smoking are complex anddeeply rooted and the necessary research on smok ing continues to expand. Public health advocatesrecognize the need for comprehensive tobaccocontrol strategies but also admonish individualsthat If you don t smoke don t start and if you dosmoke quit. Social changes and changes in indi vidual behavior are required to achieve a signiﬁ cant reduction in tobacco use. R ONALD A.

The Healthy People 2010 goal in the United States is to decrease prevalence from 24 percent to12 percent by the year 2010.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,458,This goal can only beachieved by helping current smokers to quit.Increasing the incidence of quitting is achievedthrough medications counseling strategies andpublic health approaches. IMPACT OF SMOKING In the United States smoking became increasingly popular from the early 1900s through the mid 1960s but it then declined substantially. Duringthe 1950s the link between smoking and respira tory diseases and cancer became known.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,459,In 1964 the ﬁrst Surgeon General s Report on smokingnoted the substantial health hazards associatedwith smoking. Cigarette smoke contains more than4 000 chemicals of which forty three are known tocause cancer. Among the more toxic chemicals intobacco are ammonia arsenic carbon monoxide and benzene. Cigarette smoking is now knownto cause chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD heart disease stroke multiple cancers including lung cancer and adverse reproductiveoutcomes.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,460,Smoking causes about 21 percent of alldeaths from heart disease 86 percent of deathsfrom lung cancer and 81 percent of all deathsfrom chronic lung disease. Nicotine is highly addictive and causes persist ent and compulsive smoking behavior. Most usersmake four to six quit attempts before they are ableto remain nicotine free. Smoking cessation pro duces major and immediate health beneﬁts byreducing mortality and morbidity from heart dis ease stroke cancer and various lung diseases.

About 43 per cent of U.S. children are exposed to cigarettesmoke by household members. Childhood expo sure to ETS has been shown to cause asthma and SMOKING CESSATION 1106to increase the number of episodes and severity of the disease. ETS exposure of very young childrenis also causally associated with an increased risk ofbronchitis pneumonia and ear infections.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,462,Forthese reasons the importance of smoking cessa tion extends beyond the health beneﬁt of thesmokers themselves. EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS In general clinical interventions to treat tobacco use double unassisted quit rates. Effective inter ventions include the provision of advice to quit bya health care provider the provision of behavioralcounseling and medications.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,463,Since the 1980s ef forts to reduce tobacco use have shifted away froman exclusive focus on clinical interventions to in clude a broader public health approach. Thisbroader approach increases quitting by changingsocietal norms around tobacco use and increasingthe motivation and support for people to at tempt to quit.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,464,CLINICAL INTERVENTIONS Tobacco dependence is a chronic relapsing condi tion that often requires repeated intervention.The U.S. Public Health Service s Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence Clinical Practice Guidelinedescribes the strong science base behind current treatment recommendations. Guidelines from Can ada and the United Kingdom provide similarrecommendations.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,465,Brief advice to quit smoking from a health care provider increases quit rates by 30 percent.Every person who uses tobacco should be offeredat least brief advice to quit smoking because failureto do so becomes a reason for smokers to assumetheir doctor does not consider it important totheir health. More intensive counseling individ ual group and telephone counseling and medi cations are even more effective and should beprovided to all tobacco users willing to use them. Counseling.

Currently the patch and gum are available in over the counterform the nasal spray and inhaler are available byprescription. HEALTH CARE SYSTEM SUPPORT FOR TREATMENT OF TOBACCO USE Several guidelines recommend that health care systems institutionalize the consistent identiﬁca tion documentation and treatment of every to bacco users.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,470,Another recommendation is to pro vide full insurance coverage for medication andcounseling related to tobacco use. Data show thatreducing cost barriers not only increases the use ofmore effective treatments but also increases the number of people who successfully quit. Tobacco dependence treatments are both clini cally effective and highly cost effective relative toother medical and disease prevention interven tions.

A pregnantwoman who is a heavy smoker and unable to quitshould consult her physician about the possibleuse of medication. Young People. Since most tobacco use begins during adolescence it is important to preventonset of tobacco use and to encourage cessation ata young age. Half of adolescent smokers say theywant to stop smoking cigarettes completely andabout six of ten report that they seriously tried toquit in the past year.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,474,Unfortunately adolescenttobacco users can become addicted to nicotinewithin the ﬁrst weeks of use and most adolescentsexperience symptoms of nicotine withdrawal whenthey try to quit. Therefore adolescents are as likelyto relapse as adults are. It is unclear which inter ventions will help adolescents quit. However someadolescent prevention and cessation programs showpromise in increasing quit rates.

In 1973 Arizona became the ﬁrst U.S. state to restrictsmoking in public places for health reasons. In1975 Minnesota passed a comprehensive state wide law. Although a 1972 U.S.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,491,Surgeon General s Report raised the issue of ETS it was in the 1980sthat the scientiﬁc understanding of the healtheffects of ETS increased notably. In 1986 theSurgeon General concluded that involuntary smok ing is a cause of disease including lung cancer inhealthy nonsmokers. In 1997 the California Envi ronmental Protection Agency concluded that ETScaused 3 000 lung cancer deaths and 35 000 to62 000 heart disease deaths in the United Stateseach year.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,492,Among children ETS causes bronchitis pneumonia and middle ear infections and in duces asthma attacks. ETS has also been linked tonew cases of asthma and to sudden infant deathsyndrome. As knowledge of the health effects of ETS has increased so has the strength of restrictions. Thehazards of ETS are entirely preventable and ETSrestrictions protect both workers and the public.Apart from the serious health hazards mostnonsmokers are annoyed by ETS exposure.

Smoking laws are generally respected and easy to enforce especially after an initial implementa tion period.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,498,Measures that facilitate enforcementinclude posting of no smoking signs requiringemployers proprietors to not permit illegal smok ing and prohibiting ashtrays where smoking isbanned. Public support for smoking laws is gener ally high and often increases after implementation. Smoke free workplaces may beneﬁt employ ers through increased productivity among non smokers and through reduced costs due to clean ing maintenance property damage ﬁre risk andinsurance absenteeism sick pay and worker s compensation.

SMUGGLING TOBACCO Smuggling tobacco is the illegal movement of tobacco products across domestic or internationalborders. It reduces tax revenues thereby weaken ing the effectiveness of tobacco control laws. Weak ened regulation results in increased access to to bacco by minors limits enforcement of state andfederal laws and hinders surveillance efforts totrack tobacco sales and consumption.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,504,Interstate tobacco smuggling evades state or provincial tobacco taxes. It involves legal purchasesof tobacco products in states with lower taxes andshipment of these products to states with highertaxes for illegal sale. Federal taxes are not affectedbecause they are levied at the time of initialpurchase. International tobacco smuggling evades fed eral state or provincial and local taxes and im port export duties.

G REEN SEE ALSO Enforcement of Retail Sales on Tobacco Taxation on Tobacco Tobacco Control TobaccoSales to Youth Regulation of SNOW JOHN John Snow 1813 1858 was a London physician and a founding father of modern epidemiology.He was a pioneer anesthetist who invented a newkind of mask to administer chloroform which heused on Queen Victoria to assist at the births ofher two youngest children. He was an astute clini cian and kept meticulously detailed notes abouthis patients and their diseases.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,507,His work on chol era was of lasting value because it demonstratedseveral fundamental intellectual steps that must bepart of every epidemiologic investigation. He be gan with a logical analysis of the then availablefacts which demonstrated that cholera could notbe due to a miasma a theory that was thenpopular. It could only be caused Snow deter mined by a transmissible agent most probably indrinking water.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,508,Having arrived at this logical conclusion Snow conducted two epoch making epidemiological in vestigations in the great cholera epidemic of 1853to 1854. One was a study of a severe localized SOCIAL AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES 1111epidemic in Soho using analysis of descriptive epidemiologic data and spot maps to demonstratethat the cause was polluted water from a pump inBroad Street.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,509,His investigation of the more wide spread epidemic in South London involved him inan inquiry into the source of drinking water usedin some seven hundred households.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,510,Snow com pared the water source in houses where cholerahad occurred with that in houses where it had not.His analysis showed beyond doubt that the causeof the epidemic was water that was being suppliedto houses by the Southwark and Vauxhall watercompany which drew its water from the Thamesdownriver from London where many efﬂuentdischarges polluted the water.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,511,Snow found thatvery few cases occurred in households suppliedwith water by the Lambeth company which col lected water upstream from London where therewas little or no pollution. Snow s work was remark able in that it was completed thirty years beforeRobert Koch identiﬁed the cholera bacillus. Snow published his work in a monograph On the Mode of Communication of Cholera 1855 . This classic book has been reprinted in several modern editions andis still used as a teaching text in courses ofepidemiology.

SOCIAL AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES While it is undoubtedly true that a biomedical perspective dominated public health in the ﬁrsthalf of the twentieth century there has emerged largely since World War II a social science per spective in public health.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,513,This perspective hasdeveloped in departments of social and commu nity medicine in Europe and in schools of publichealth in the United States and it is reﬂected in thegrowth of the behavioral and social sciences in thecurricula for public health professional and re search degrees.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,514,This perspective is also evident inthe establishment of departments of social andbehavioral sciences in universities.Many social and behavioral science disciplines are relevant to the understanding and articulationof the mission of public health.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,515,It would be impos sible to document here all the various disciplineareas these include disciplines as diverse as psy chology economics history and anthropology.The focus here will be on those disciplines thatmost directly attempt to describe understand predict and change the public s health. SOCIAL AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES LITERATURE A considerable literature on individual behavior and public health has developed in the second halfof the twentieth century.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,516,The general failure ofpublic health to pick up and nurture the moremacro social science perspectives to the samedegree has limited the full potential of the impactof the social and behavioral sciences on publichealth particularly because the historical roots ofpublic health in the latter half of the nineteenthcentury included a strong social structural view point.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,517,Since that time the theoretical develop ment of economics political science sociology and anthropology has accelerated but it was oftennot brought to bear on contemporary public healthissues because these issues were often deﬁned interms of the characteristics of individuals ratherthan as characteristics of social structure. Theargument is then that public health picked up thewrong end of the social science stick the individ ual micro end rather than the sociocultural macro end.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,518,This assertion is supported by anyperusal of public health journals or literature onsocial and behavioral science in public health inthe second half of the twentieth century.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,519,Nonethe less as the end of the twentieth century in publichealth witnessed increasing concern with socialconcepts such as social inequity inequality andcommunity interventions the disciplines of sociol ogy anthropology economics and political sci ence had a more important role in public health for the determinants of health were being deﬁnedin terms of a social and behavioral perspective.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,520,Forexample many individual behaviors were recog nized as risk factors for poor health but were alsoseen as embedded in a wider social context. Inaddition a social science informed healthful pub lic policy was seen by many as a key to the develop ment of public health strategies to improve health. SOCIAL AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES 1112THE SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINES AND PUBLIC HEALTH As noted previously there are several social and behavioral science disciplines applied to publichealth.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,521,What follows is a brief summary of each ofthe key disciplines with attention given to thetheory and work of each discipline relevant topublic health. In some of the social science disci plines there are large subdisciplinary areas de voted to medicine. For example there are largesubdisciplinary ﬁelds such as history of medicine medical sociology medical anthropology healthpsychology and medical geography.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,522,Most of thesesubdisciplines have university departments dedi cated journals and professional organizations. How ever most of these subdisciplines are concernedwith medicine in the very broadest interpretation including health promotion clinical care diseaseprevention and biomedical research. Only a partof a subdiscipline such as medical sociology isconcerned with public health.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,523,Similarly most ofthe subdiscipline of history of medicine is con cerned with the development and evolution ofclinical medicine rather than public health. Thus the interpretation of the role of the social andbehavioral sciences in public health is very muchtied to one s deﬁnition of public health. THE SOCIAL AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE DISCIPLINES The social sciences are concerned with the study of human society and with the relationship of indi viduals in and to society.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,524,The chief academicdisciplines of the social sciences are anthropology economics history political science and sociol ogy. The behavioral sciences particularly psychol ogy are concerned with the study of the actions ofhumans and animals. The key effort of the behav ioral sciences is to understand predict and inﬂu ence behavior.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,525,The chief academic disciplines ofthe behavioral sciences are anthropology psychol ogy and sociology with the distinction betweensocial and behavioral science often blurred whenthese disciplines are applied in public health re search and practice particularly in schools of pub lic health and governmental agencies.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,526,Many ifnot most public health approaches are problemfocused and lead to a multidiscipline solutionencompassing several social and behavioral sci ence disciplines and combinations of them suchas social psychology in addition to other pub lic health disciplines such as epidemiology andbiostatistics. Anthropology. Anthropology is a broad social science concerned with the study of humans froma social biological and cultural perspective.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,527,His torically it is a Western based social science with roots in Europe and North America.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,528,It includestwo broad areas of physical and sociocultural an thropology both are relevant to public health.Physical anthropology divides into two areas onerelated to tracing human evolution and the studyof primates and the other concerned with con temporary human characteristics stemming fromthe mixture of genetic adaptations and culture.Medical anthropologists with this perspective areoften concerned with the relationships betweenculture illness health and nutrition.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,529,Sociocultu ral anthropology is concerned with broad aspectsof the adaptation of humans to their cultures with social organization language ethnographicdetails and in general the understanding of cul turally mitigated patterns of behavior. In recentdecades this perspective has taken a more ecologi cally focused view of the human species. From apublic health perspective this approach to anthro pology is probably most salient in terms of themethodological approaches used by anthropolo gists.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,530,They have a critical concern with under standing communities through participant obser vation. Indeed participation is probably the keyconcept linking modern day anthropological ap proaches to twentieth century concepts of publichealth community interventions. Although themethodology of rapport based structured inter views and observation is a highly developed meth odology among anthropologists it has had limitedapplication in public health.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,531,More recent efforts inpublic health to address issues of inequity at thecommunity level have created more attention toanthropological approaches. Economics. Economics is perhaps the oldest of the social sciences with its concern with wealthand poverty trade and industry. However current economic thinking generally dates from the last three centuries and is associated with the greatnames in economic thinking such as Adam Smith Robert Malthus David Ricardo John Stuart Mill and Karl Marx.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,532,Present day economics is an ad vanced study of production employment ex change and consumption driven by sophisticated SOCIAL AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES 1113mathematical models. Basically the ﬁeld breaks into two distinctive areas microeconomics andmacroeconomics. Microeconomics is largely con cerned with issues such as competitive markets wage rates and proﬁt margins. Macroeconomicsdeals with broader issues such as national income employment and economic systems.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,533,The relation ship between economics and health is obviousbecause in developed countries the percentage ofgross national product consumed by the healthcare industry is signiﬁcant generally ranging from5 to 15 percent of the gross national product. Inthe poorer countries the cost of disease to theoverall economy can prohibit the sound economic development of the country. In recent years there has been a concern with both the global economicburden of disease as well as with investment inhealth.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,534,That poverty is highly related to poorpublic health is a widely accepted tenet of modern day thinking in public health. However economicsystems ranging from free enterprise through lib eral socialism and communism offer quite differ ing alternatives to the reduction of poverty and thedistribution of economic resources. Psychology. Psychology is probably the most common disciplinary background found in theapplication of the social and behavioral sciences topublic health.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,535,Modern psychology is a large ﬁeldthat encompasses physiological psychology con cerned with the nervous and circulatory systems as well as social psychology and concerned withthe behavior of individuals as inﬂuenced by so cial stimuli. In general psychology is concernedwith the relationship of living organisms to theirenvironment.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,536,In addition to studies focused onphysiological mechanisms psychology is concernedwith the broad area of human cognition includ ing learning memory and concept formation.The subﬁeld of abnormal psychology is concernedwith mental disorders ranging from psychoses toneuroses. The subﬁeld of clinical psychology of fers direct patient care mechanisms to treat men tal problems in individuals. Thus the applicationof psychological approaches to health is quiteapparent.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,537,However the most salient branch of psychol ogy for public health practice and particularly forthe task of understanding the determinants ofhealth is probably social psychology. A majorfocus of social psychology is on attitudes opin ions and behaviors. Thus there is an emphasis onunderstanding how groups and individuals inter act with one another. The degree to which manyinteractions are easy or difﬁcult can play a majorrole in determining the stability of groups andindividuals.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,538,Therefore broad concepts such asstress social cohesion peer inﬂuence civic trust and others derive strong theoretical and researchsupport from social psychology. Sociology. Sociology is perhaps the broadest of the social science ﬁelds applied to public health.It is also characterized by being eclectic in itsborrowing from the other social sciences. Thus sociology is also concerned with organizations economics and political issues as well as individ ual behaviors in relation to the broader social milieu.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,539,A key concept in sociology however is anemphasis on society rather than the individual.The individual is viewed as an actor within a largersocial process. This distinguishes the ﬁeld frompsychology. Thus the emphasis is on units of analy sis at the collective level such as the family the group the neighborhood the city the organiza tion the state and the world.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,540,Sociology is con cerned with how the social fabric or social struc ture is maintained and how social processes suchas conﬂict and resolution relate to the mainte nance and change of social structures. A sociolo gist studies processes that create maintain andsustain a social system such as a health care systemin a country.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,541,The scientiﬁc component of thisstudy would be the concern with the processesregulating and shaping the health care system.Sociology assumes that social structure and socialprocesses are very complex. THE SOCIAL AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES WORKING TOGETHER Many social and behavioral scientists who work in public health have strong disciplinary based un dergraduate and graduate training in one of thesocial sciences.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,542,However the practice of academicand governmental public health involves discipli nary bases that are seldom as narrow as they wouldbe in traditional university based academic de partments. Indeed in many government institu tions of public health such discipline trained socialscientists may be simply referred to as healthscientists or even as social epidemiologists.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,543,Publichealth practice is largely problem focused andwhatever disciplinary base is appropriate to the SOCIAL AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES 1114problem will be used. Thus it would not be un common for a person trained as a psychologist tobe involved with a program addressed at commu nity change or for an anthropologist to be involvedwith individual behavioral change.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,544,Nonetheless all of the social and behavioral sciences share acommonality in approach to public health thatdiffers from that of the biomedical approach.Disease is usually seen as a distal outcome thefocus being on those social and behavioral proc esses that prevent and reduce disease in people.Generally the social sciences take a view thathealth and sickness are only one part of people slifestyle. The social and behavioral sciences have varied and broad based methodologies.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,545,Discussions ofmethodological approaches to knowledge attain ment are at the heart of many discipline baseddiscussions. Perhaps the greatest ongoing debateis that over the role of qualitative and quantitativeapproaches to understanding. Many researchersand practitioners in public health consider data tobe the sine qua non of public health. Often dataare perceived as being quantitative and numerate.The social and behavioral sciences take a muchbroader view of what data is.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,546,Data can be personalaccounts and stories as well as statistical presenta tions. Nonetheless the rigor underpinning theappropriate collection of good data applies toboth the quantitative and qualitative approaches.There is a strong appreciation that many quasi scientiﬁc cognitive ideas such as race poverty ortrust cannot simply be quantiﬁed and understoodnumerically yet still play a key role in determininghealth outcomes.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,547,THE DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH In discussing the determinants of health it is useful to distinguish between the health of individualsand populations. The determinants of health forany individual relate highly to the unique charac teristics of that individual. In the ﬁrst instance these characteristics are highly determined bybiology the gender age and genetic backgroundof the individual. These characteristics play a pri mary determining role and are usually not modiﬁ able.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,548,For example it is obvious that a man cannotdie from ovarian cancer or a woman from testicu lar cancer. Generally only an older person willsuffer from Alzheimer s disease only a personwith a genetic deﬁcit will suffer from Down syn drome. Medical science and public health can do little to change these powerful determinants ofhealth in the individual.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,549,However it is also antici pated that most individuals born in the Westernworld of the twenty ﬁrst century are biologicallyequipped to have a life expectancy of some seventyto eighty years. The health of populations is a different con cept from that of the health of individuals and thedeterminants of the health of populations may beconceptualized very broadly.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,550,The following is justa short list of some of the hypothesized determi nants of population health health care services sewers and drains potable water sanitation ade quate nutrition shelter transportation networks supportive social environments healthful publicpolicy stable child rearing environments health ful work environments and peace and tranquility.What is apparent in such a broad list is that most ofthe hypothesized determinants are outside of thetraditional medical care sector of clinics and hospi tals.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,551,Many determinants of population health aredetermined by human conditions at the broadestlevel of political interaction such as the protectionfrom the ravages of poverty war and refugeestatus.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,552,Most important the individual has rela tively little direct control over these determinants.Even in those arenas where the individual believeshe or she has control such as in pursuit of educa tion occupation and income through the lifespan the reality remains that access to education occupation and income is socially determined. People suffer disease and illness due to social processes that are only remotely related to per sonal health care.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,553,As public health moves awayfrom personal health care as the major determi nant of public health to a position where it ismerely one of many determinants of public health the role of the social and behavioral sciences be comes more important in understanding popula tion health.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,554,The World Health Organization Euro pean Ofﬁce lists ten social determinants of healththat are supported by strong research evidence 1 the social gradient people s relative social andeconomic status and circumstances strongly affecttheir health throughout life 2 stress stress harmshealth 3 early life the effects of early develop ment last a lifetime 4 social exclusion socialexclusion creates misery and costs lives 5 work SOCIAL AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES 1115 stress in the workplace increases the risk of dis ease 6 unemployment job security increaseshealth well being and job satisfaction 7 socialsupport friendship good social relations andstrong supportive networks improve health athome at work and in the community 8 addic tion individuals turn to alcohol drugs and to bacco and suffer from their use but use is inﬂu enced by the wider social setting 9 food healthfulfood is a political issue and 10 transport health ful transport means reducing driving and encour aging more walking and cycling backed up bybetter public transport .
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,555,THE ROLE OF THE SOCIAL AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES In contributing to the understanding of the deter minants of health there are two chief challengesfor the social and behavioral sciences. The ﬁrst isto continue to build in greater depth the knowl edge and evidence base for the role of socioeco nomic factors in health. The second is to developappropriate best practices for addressing the roleof socioeconomic factors in order to improve thehealth of the public.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,556,These are related challenges but the ﬁrst is perhaps more of a challenge for theacademic world and the second for the world ofpublic health practice. Despite the enormous com plexity inherent in these challenges there is a largeand growing literature to address both of them.There is a very large literature in Western lan guages addressing the role of socioeconomic sta tus SES and its relationship to mortality andmorbidity in infants children adolescents andyoung and old adults.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,557,In general the availableevidence is more extensive for working aged adults where multiple studies from many countries showpowerful evidence linking low SES to increasedchronic disease mortality and morbidity amongmales and a consistent gradient of the association between levels of SES and levels of health.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,558,Conceptually this is a very complex and exten sive area for research because of the large numberof variable combinations in any research approach.Thus if one takes SES as the determinant ofinterest it needs to be studied for its impact onevery age group gender and ethnic or racialgroup in relation to many possible outcomes including chronic disease morbidity and mortalityand risk factors for each disease. The resulting matrix of variable combinations is indeed exceed ingly complex.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,559,Even though research has looked atmany of the relationships possible they clearlyhave not all been explored in the detail to bringsurety in conclusions. That is why the researchchallenge is so great there is much more basicresearch that needs to be undertaken to fullyunderstand the complexities associated with thesocial determinants of health. The second challenge is even more critical and is at the heart of public health ideology.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,560,Publichealth is predicated on the idea that one wants totake action to prevent or control disease at thesame time public health is also concerned withpromoting health and preventing disease at thepopulation level. Thus the ideal strategies forpublic health practice call for action at the popula tion level. It is however one thing to understandthe complex mechanisms that link social determi nants to health it is quite another to try and alterthem. At ﬁrst glance it would appear that thesolution is simple.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,561,If poverty causes poor health then elimination of poverty should increase theoverall population health. Few could disagree nonetheless poverty itself is the result of manycontributing factors. Furthermore many in publichealth might well argue that large scale programs to eliminate poverty such as equal income distri bution policies are well beyond the scope of pub lic health practice and carry with them politicalrisks and an adverse impact on economic aspectsof a society.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,562,One social science approach is to look at the scope and characteristics of the problem and thendetermine what is a feasible course of action tomaximize beneﬁts within the restraints of a givensocial system an approach that is based on therealities within any given country s sociopoliticalsystem. Such an approach recognizes the diversityand variability both within and between sovereigncountries but at the same time recognizes theglobal interdependence of all countries.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,563,Nonethe less when public health researchers and agencieswithin countries have addressed the socioeconomicdeterminants of health from the standpoint ofinterventions several common themes emerge. First there is the recognition of the need to pursue macro level economic and social policies SOCIAL ASSESSMENT IN HEALTH PROMOTION PLANNING 1116that create investment in the physical and social determinants of health.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,564,In general this means aneffort to address broad issues to improve healthcare infrastructure education transportation sys tems and housing as well as participation in a justsociety. It also means addressing inequities andissues of poverty. Such approaches are made ex plicit in documents such as Healthy People 2010 . Second there is a strong attention to the community as the setting for public health inter ventions.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,565,That is the everyday living and workingconditions must be improved particularly whenthese are accompanied by poverty and the plightof disadvantaged groups. Increasing control of theenvironment by those within it is a strong compo nent of a participation based intervention approach. Third behavioral risk factors remain a critical component of interventions to address the social determinants of health.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,566,Although the social set ting and milieu may produce many barriers tobehavior change there remains considerable lati tude at the individual level for change. Particularly inthe addictive behaviors the role of the individualremains powerful and inescapable. Evidence basedinterventions need to combine the knowledge ofthe social and behavioral science disciplines toaddress the complexity of behavioral change.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,567,Fourth the personal health care system is seen as a critical component of the determinants ofhealth and is the system closest to the professionsof most of those who labor in the ﬁeld of publichealth. The critical issue for the personal healthcare system is to address the inequities in access toquality care. These inequities stem from many determinants including poverty and prejudice. Sociodemographic factors such as geography andurbanization also play a key role.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,568,Adequate andequitable distribution of health care resourcesremains a challenge for the entire globe as doeshumane treatment and attention to social andpsychological factors in the overall well being ofpatients and families seen in these settings.

SOCIAL ASSESSMENT IN HEALTH PROMOTIONPLANNING Within the context of health promotion social assessment refers to a process in which objectiveand subjective information are used to identifyhigh priority problems or assets that affect thecommon good.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,573,Ideally this process will use avariety of social economic and quality of life indi cators including the perceptions and concerns ofrepresentatives from the area or community beingassessed. There are strong connections between major health problems e.g. violence chronic disease SOCIAL ASSESSMENT IN HEALTH PROMOTION PLANNING 1117teen pregnancy and their social determinants e.g.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,574,cultural differences variability in levels ofincome social support housing and education .While these factors tend to cluster within neigh borhoods or communities they vary considerablybetween communities. Any social assessment shouldbe designed to take these realities into account.Armed with the information generated from asocial assessment planners will be in a better position to tailor interventions to meet the unique needs of a given community.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,575,MULTIPLE INDICATORS There are different ways of knowing and different interpretations of reality. An epidemiologist ananthropologist a health educator and a laypersonare all likely to view a given problem throughdifferent lenses. More importantly each is quitelikely to detect a glimpse of reality that the othersmay miss.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,576,The social assessment process will beproductive to the extent that 1 it serves as a ﬁrststep in a planning process 2 it reﬂects a spirit ofinclusion 3 time is dedicated to allow all stake holders to discuss and interpret information gainedin the process and 4 those discussions are car ried out in an atmosphere of mutual respectand trust. The literature describing methods and instru ments to assess quality of life and social indicatorsis extensive and growing.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,577,Included among theobjective and subjective indicators that may beused as a part of social assessment include percep tions of quality of life sense of community per ceived functional capacity employment rates dif ferences in levels of income access to transportationand transportation services alcohol related autocrashes housing density crime trust or distrust ingovernment air and water quality access to health mental health and social services and education.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,578,A wide range of methods have been used to collect data for social assessments. These include but are not limited to interviewing those who havea stake in the outcomes of a relevant program orproject community town meetings focus groups community polls and surveys archival research reviews of income housing status access to healthservices and other relevant social indicators andsynthetic estimates from national data interpo lated to the local level.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,579,As a means to save limitedresources some planners retrieve existing infor mation whenever possible rather than generatenew data. Federal state and local ofﬁces of hous ing and urban planning keep reasonably up to date summary records. Most of these data are inthe public domain and are easily accessible though ameaningful social assessment will inevitably re quire the allocation of resources to gather newinformation perceived as relevant to the popula tion being studied.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,580,ASSETS As implied in the deﬁnition a social assessment in health promotion should involve an accounting ofcommunity and individual assets as well as identiﬁ cation of problems or concerns.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,581,John McKnightand John Kretzmann describe a process of com munity asset mapping wherein relevant skills andcapacities of individuals as well as other assets thatmay exist in a given community are documented.These assets are classiﬁed into three tiers of pri mary secondary and potential building blocks.Primary building blocks are those that exist andare controlled within a given community e.g. alocal health agency or a local teacher they arealso the assets that are most accessible.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,582,Secondarybuilding blocks are those that exist within a com munity but are controlled from outside the com munity e.g. a health clinic which is a satellite of aregional or corporate medical system . Potential building blocks are those located and controlled outside of the community e.g. federal grant pro grams or national campaigns . An analysis of thiskind will help planners keep a realistic perspectiveon the comparative difﬁculty of accessing the as sets they have identiﬁed.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,583,Another example of using positive indicators is found in Peter Benson s work on the develop mental assets that inﬂuence children and adoles cents. Benson describes forty developmental as sets which are classiﬁed equally into two categories 1 internal assets related to the personal qualitiesof children e.g. self esteem achievement motiva tion and 2 external assets e.g. family and adultsupport safety programs and services .

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,585,RESPECT Lawrence Green and others have made the point that health is an instrumental value that is a valuethat facilitates the striving for or attainment of higher order or ultimate values. For example acompany may value a commitment to physicalﬁtness and nutrition to the extent that it inﬂuencesemployee performance and satisfaction.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,586,The im plication is that health has value to the extent thatit either supports or enables higher order values which may include social beneﬁts overall qualityof life the capacity to function or even an organi zation s bottom line. This point is relevant to socialassessment because information gleaned from theprocess can be used to illustrate how the effectiveapplication of health promotion programs con tributes to the improvement of social beneﬁtsbeyond improvements in health.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,592,Leaders and follow ers strong and weak rich and poor social classiﬁ cations are universal. Humans have inventednumerous ways to classify people by wealth power or prestige by ability education or occu pation even by where they live. The term socialclass originally referred to groups of people hold ing similar roles in the economic processes ofproduction and exchange such as landowner ortenant employer or employee.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,593,Such positions cor respond to different levels of status prestige andaccess to political power but social class eventuallytook on a more generic meaning and came to referto all aspects of a person s rank in the socialhierarchy. Belonging to a social class is not merely an objective fact but is generally accompanied by a SOCIAL CLASS 1119perception of class identity. In this sense social class is not merely a personal attribute but alsoa contextual variable that characterizes a group ofpeople.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,594,The shared culture of a particular classinﬂuences and is inﬂuenced by people s atti tudes and lifestyle. Social class therefore inﬂu ences health. Centuries of observations have linked social class to patterns of disease see Krieger Williams and Moss 1997 . Accordingly epide miologists frequently present statistics on mortal ity and morbidity tabulated by social class as shownin Figures 1 and 2.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,595,However social class is anabstract and complex concept whose inﬂuence isblended with many others in predicting disease.Both Figures 1 and 2 for example show how theeffects of social class here indicated by familyincome and educational level interact with racialor ethnic factors. However classiﬁcations by age religion race or sex lack the implication of hierar chy and are not normally considered under theheading of social class.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,596,Social class may be ascribed at birth as with royalty or nobility or with castes in Hindu socie ties. More commonly however a person s posi tion at birth is modiﬁed by his or her achieve ments typically through education occupation or income. Class cannot be measured directly.Instead indicators of socioeconomic status typi cally based on educational attainment income wealth or occupation are used.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,597,While few wouldconsider these to be ideal indicators of social class they nonetheless show consistent associations withhealth status such that poorer or less educatedpeople die younger and experience more illnessand disability than richer or more educated peo ple. These indicators each have strengths andshortcomings. A simple occupational classiﬁcation has been used in Britain throughout the twentieth centuryfor analyses linking social class and health.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,598,TheBritish Registrar General for Births and Deathsranks occupations in six broad categories thatreﬂect a judgment of the skill level and socialprestige of each occupation.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,599,This has been fol lowed by other more complex classiﬁcations suchas the 100 point occupational scale of Tremain.This applies internationally and allows compari sons between developing and industrial countries.These categories have the advantage of capturingthe notion of shared culture implicit in social class Figure 1 Life Expectancy at Age 45 by Family Income Race and Sex United States 1979 89 2025303540 White Females Black Females White Males Black Males 10 000 14 999 15 000 24 999 25 000 Family IncomeLife Expectancy at age 45 SOURCE G.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,601,Furthermore the status of occupationschanges with economic development complicat ing comparisons across times and across cultures.Finally occupation shares a limitation with in come in that reverse causality may occur wherebyoccupational status or income may be inﬂuencedby the level of health.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,602,The advantages of education as an indicator of social status include simplicity and universality educational level can be recorded for all adults whether working or not and it is less likely thanoccupation or income to be inﬂuenced by health.But education is generally ﬁnished in early adult hood and may no longer reﬂect a person s statusin later years.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,603,Care must also be taken when draw ing comparisons of educational levels across gen erations since educational attainment changesfrom generation to generation. Income or wealth are also frequently used as indicators of social class and hold the advantageof sensitivity to variations in a person s status overtime. Wealth is not simple to record however data on income must be supplemented by infor mation on the number of people supported by theincome and on other assets such as savings andproperty.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,605,While socioeconomic status is generally con sidered a characteristic of individuals contextualmeasures of social class may also be relevant inexplaining patterns of health. Thus for a popula tion we may record not only the average level ofincome or wealth but also the extent of incomedisparities or class divergence in the society. Suchindicators can indicate social class characteristicsof the society rather than summarizing patterns inthe society.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,606,Contemporary epidemiologic analyses assume that it is not so much social class per se thatinﬂuences health but characteristics associatedwith class. There are several channels throughwhich class or socioeconomic position may inﬂu ence health Certain health hazards may be directly associated with social position such asexposure to hazardous substances orprocesses in the workplace.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,607,Alternatively social class may inﬂuence health via behaviors that follow socialpatterns such as diet cigarette smoking or leisure time physical activity. Wealth can inﬂuence health directly by providing access to safe and healthyhousing adequate food and medical care and supplies when needed. Wealth alsoenhances educational attainment in aperson s children and so inﬂuences theirsubsequent earning capacity in this man ner the association between poverty andhealth tends to perpetuate itself acrossgenerations.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,608,Education also facilitates access to infor mation that can beneﬁt health. Moreeducated people are better able tocommunicate with their physicians andinteract with the health care system andmake informed choices among treatmentoptions. Higher social status is associated with attitudes such as positive self esteem or asense of being in control of one s life that are positively associated with a rangeof indicators of health especially mental health .
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,609,Such feelings are difﬁcult to maintain when a person is unemployed. Contemporary analyses of social class in health research have evolved from using it as a simpleclassiﬁcation toward using class as a starting pointfor a more complete analysis of possible channelsof inﬂuence. The next stage perhaps will be toincorporate an understanding of social class dy namics into designing approaches to preventionand health promotion.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,613,This is achievedthrough self regulatory subfunctions that provideguides and motivators for self directed change.People have to keep track of their health habits.Self monitoring provides the information neededfor setting realistic goals and for evaluating one sprogress toward them. People motivate themselvesand guide their behavior by the goals and chal lenges they set for themselves. Goals motivate byenlisting self evaluative involvement in the activ ity.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,614,The evaluative self reactions provide the meansby which personal standards regulate coursesof action. PERSONAL EFFICACY The self management system operating through self monitoring goal setting and self reactive in ﬂuence is rooted in beliefs of personal efﬁcacy.This core belief system is the foundation of humanmotivation and action. Unless people believe theycan produce desired effects by their actions theyhave little incentive to act or to persevere in theface of difﬁculties.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,615,In social cognitive theory perceived efﬁcacy is a key determinant because it affects lifestyle habitsboth directly and by its inﬂuence on other deter minants. The stronger the perceived efﬁcacy thehigher the goals people set for themselves themore they expect their efforts to produce desiredoutcomes and the more they view obstacles andimpediments to personal change as surmountable. Development of self regulatory capabilities re quires instilling a resilient sense of efﬁcacy as wellas imparting skills.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,616,Experiences in exercising con trol over troublesome situations serve as efﬁcacybuilders. If people are not convinced of theirpersonal efﬁcacy they rapidly abandon the skills they have been taught when they fail to get quickresults or suffer reverses.

The self efﬁcacy belief system oper ates as a common mechanism through whichpsychosocial treatments affect different types ofhealth outcomes.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,618,PUBLIC HEALTH APPLICATIONS People see little point in even trying if they be lieve they do not have what it takes to succeed.In community wide health campaigns people spreexisting efﬁcacy beliefs and the efﬁcacy beliefsinstilled by the campaign contribute to adoptionof health promoting habits. This calls for a changein emphasis from trying to scare people into healthto enabling them to achieve self directed change.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,620,The guiding principles implementativepractices and empirical documentation of effec tiveness are reviewed in some detail in Self Efﬁcacy The Exercise of Control Bandura 1997 . By combin ing the high individualization of the clinical ap proach with the large scale applicability of thepublic health approach health self managementsystems ensure high social utility. It is easier to prevent detrimental health habits than to try to change them after they have becomedeeply entrenched as part of a lifestyle.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,621,The socialcognitive model provides a valuable public healthtool for societal efforts to promote the health of itsyouth. Preventive programs often produce weakresults because they are heavy on didactics butmeager on personal enablement. Health knowl edge can be conveyed readily but changes invalues attitudes and health habits require greatereffort. Health promotion programs that encom pass the essential elements of the self regulatorymodel achieve greater success.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,625,SOCIAL DETERMINANTS Any case of a disease results from a long and complex chain of characteristics circumstances and events. The terms used to refer to the stages inthis causal chain are not well agreed upon how ever. Causal factors are loosely grouped into pre cipitating causes which refer to agent factors suchas a virus and some aspects of the host such asinadequate nutrition which increases susceptibil ity.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,626,The events and environmental factors that giverise to the immediate causal factors are oftentermed determinants. These include biological physical and social circumstances. Determinantsaccount in some measure for the underlyingrates of disease in a population while variations in these rates are explained by risk factors. The socialdeterminants of health include socioeconomic cir cumstances social structure and function andcultural factors.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,627,Social determinants refer to broadpatterns and not to individual details the state ofbeing married would constitute a risk factor forsome conditions while the cultural and economiccircumstances that lead to high divorce rates mightform a social determinant of mental health in aparticular population. The use of the term determinants deserves some clariﬁcation. In most instances it does notimply a deterministic relationship as might holdin chemistry for example. Nor does it imply theabsence of free will.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,628,Instead determinants refer tomacrosocial inﬂuences that affect health such aspoverty or social strife and that would prove verydifﬁcult for an individual to alter. Perhaps the broadest social determinant of health is a country s level of social and economicdevelopment. This is related to patterns of longev ity health and disease but the relationship isdynamic and far from simple and economic devel opment and health status inﬂuence one another.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,629,Patterns of disease shift as a country s economygrows producing the epidemiologic transition froma pattern of short life expectancy and high mor tality due to infectious disease to a pattern oflong life expectancy and deaths due mainly tononinfectious chronic diseases that are typical ofindustrial countries. Social determinants inﬂuencehealth through many intervening factors such asthe quality of sanitation medical care or fooddistribution systems.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,630,Examples are provided bythe twentieth century adverse impact on healthseen in Eastern European countries in the formerSoviet bloc. While social determinants undoubtedly exert much of their inﬂuence through individual behav iors that promote or prevent disease it is also clearthat disease patterns cannot be fully explained interms of individual behaviors.

SOCIAL HEALTH The concept of social health is less intuitively familiar than that of physical or mental health andyet along with physical and mental health it formsone of the three pillars of most deﬁnitions ofhealth. This is partly because social health canrefer both to a characteristic of a society and ofindividuals.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,634,A society is healthy when there isequal opportunity for all and access by all to thegoods and services essential to full functioning as acitizen Russell 1973 p. 75 . Indicators of thehealth of a society might include the existence ofthe rule of law equality in the distribution ofwealth public accessibility of the decision makingprocess and the level of social capital.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,635,The social health of individuals refers to that dimension of an individual s well being that con cerns how he gets along with other people howother people react to him and how he interactswith social institutions and societal mores Rus sell 1973 p. 75 . This deﬁnition is broad it incor porates elements of personality and social skills reﬂects social norms and bears a close relation ship to concepts such as well being adjustment and social functioning.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,636,Formal consideration of social health was stimu lated in 1947 by its inclusion in the World HealthOrganization s deﬁnition of health and by theresulting emphasis on treating patients as socialbeings who live in a complex social context. Socialhealth has also become relevant with the increas ing evidence that those who are well integratedinto their communities tend to live longer andrecover faster from disease.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,637,Conversely social iso lation has been shown to be a risk factor for illness.Hence social health may be deﬁned in terms ofsocial adjustment and social support or the abil ity to perform normal roles in society. Deﬁnitions of social health in terms of adjust ment derive from sociology and psychiatry. Poorsocial adjustment forms a common indicator ofneurotic illness and adjustment may be used torecord the outcome of care especially for psycho therapy.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,638,Adjustment may be rated subjectively orit may be judged in terms of a person s fulﬁllmentof social roles how adequately a person is func tioning compared to normal social expectations.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,644,Within the last thirty years social marketing s application to public health problems has grownrapidly. Today a wide range of public health andsocial service organizations in the United Statesare using social marketing including the Centersfor Disease Control and Prevention CDC the National Cancer Institute NCI the United States Department of Agriculture USDA the UnitedStates Department of Health and Human Services USDHHS and the American Association ofRetired Persons AARP .
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,645,Public health administra tors and health educators at the state and locallevel have also begun using social marketing as anapproach for developing programs to bring aboutbehavior change. Social marketing organizationshave emerged to meet the growing demand fortechnical assistance with consumer research stra tegic planning communications media advocacy and other components in the social marketingprocess.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,646,Although formal degrees and credentialingare not awarded at this time social marketingcourses are now offered in many colleges of public health and business schools. THE SOCIAL MARKETING APPROACH The term social marketing was coined in 1971 by Kotler and Zaltman in their seminal article So cial Marketing An Approach to Planned SocialChange.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,647,It is deﬁned as the application of com mercial marketing technologies to the analysis planning execution and evaluation of programsdesigned to inﬂuence voluntary behavior of targetaudiences in order to improve their personal wel fare and that of their society Andreasen 1995. p.7 .
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,648,Social marketing is distinguished from othermanagement approaches by six basic principles 1 the marketing conceptual framework is used todesign behavior change interventions 2 there isrecognition of competition 3 there is a con sumer orientation 4 formative research is usedto understand consumers desires and needs 5 there is a segmentation of populations and carefulselection of target audiences and 6 continuousmonitoring and revision of program tactics help toachieve desired outcomes.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,649,MARKETING S CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK Social marketing relies on commercial market ing s conceptual framework to guide program de velopment and implementation. This frameworkplaces consumers at the center of an exchangeprocess in which they act primarily out of self interest attempting to maximize the ability tosatisfy wants and needs and minimize the cost todo so.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,650,Social marketing identiﬁes consumer wantsand needs and then develops ways to satisfy them.Marketing s framework or the marketing mix includes ﬁve components involved in the exchangeprocess the product in social marketing theproduct is the health behavior or service beingpromoted its competition the risk behavior cur rently practiced the price social emotional andmonetary costs exchanged for the product s bene ﬁts place where the exchange takes place or thetarget behavior is practiced and promotion ac tivities used to facilitate the exchange .
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,651,Social marketing may be used to get people to adopt new protective behaviors such as healthful SOCIAL MARKETING 1125diets or exercise or to stop practicing risky behav iors such as smoking. The product may also be aservice such as prenatal care or immunization with the objective being to increase people s utili zation of the service. A commodity such as acondom may also be promoted but again thefocus is on the behavior associated with thecommodity.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,652,The behavior being promoted must provide beneﬁts relevant to consumers. For this reason marketers are interested in people s aspirationsand desires as well as their social or medical needs. The marketing model also considers the com petition posed by unhealthful or risky behaviors.Often people must make a choice between protec tive or healthful behaviors and risky alternatives. In marketing terms the price of adopting a healthful behavior is also considered from theconsumer s perspective.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,653,What will the consumerexchange in order to obtain the product s bene ﬁts Some health behaviors require consumers toexchange money for the product such as the costof an exercise or weight loss program. Other pub lic health products such as the WIC program mayappear to be free. Closer examination reveals indi rect monetary costs such as lost wages bus fares or childcare fees that accompany the utilization ofWIC services.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,654,Often costs are nonmonetary in cluding time effort embarrassment and the per ceived loss of pride and dignity associated withparticipation in government assistance programsor adopting certain behaviors. To make the exchange more attractive to con sumers social marketing seeks to lower costs andto maximize beneﬁts. Unfortunately many protec tive health behaviors come with costs that aredifﬁcult to control. For some people safe sexpractices are not as pleasurable as the riskier com petition.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,655,Many people have a hard time sacriﬁcingthe taste satiety and perceived pleasure of a high fat diet. Nevertheless social marketers work tocreate an acceptable cost beneﬁt ratio. The third P in marketing s framework is place the location where services are provided where tangible products are distributed or whereconsumers receive information about new prod ucts or behaviors. Research is conducted to iden tify life path points places that consumer sfrequent so that products and information canbe placed there.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,656,Social marketing also identiﬁes when and where a target audience will be mostreceptive to promotional messages. The fourth P is promotion. Social marketing relies on health communications to inform andeducate consumers. However education and pub lic information are only a part of a carefully plannedset of activities designed to bring about change.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,657,Infact an effective promotional strategy may includeseveral communication elements including objec tives for each target audience guidelines for de signing attention getting and effective messages designation of appropriate communication chan nels and credible trustworthy spokespersons.Some large scale multifaceted projects rely onmass communications public information publicrelations consumer education lotteries directmail and other means.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,658,Projects with more limitedcommunications components may rely solely onpersonal counseling and print materials. Finally to be effective promotional strategies must becarefully coordinated with other components ofthe marketing mix. Promotional efforts cannot succeed if the product s beneﬁts price and place ment are not also in line with the people s wantsand needs.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,659,CONSUMER ORIENTATION A central principle in the social marketing mindset is a commitment to understand the consumer andto design products to satisfy consumers wants andneeds. Those applying social marketing methodsneed to know about the people whose behaviorthey want to change their aspirations and values their relevant beliefs and attitudes and their cur rent behavioral patterns.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,660,They also look at thebroader social and cultural factors that inﬂuenceconsumer behavior recognizing that behavioralchange is inﬂuenced by a combination of environ mental as well as personal and interpersonal factors. Unfortunately many people still incorrectly equate marketing with sales and advertising. Mar keting s consumer orientation is actually the an tithesis of a sales orientation.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,661,In contrast to thebelief that sales stimulating devices are needed tobring results a consumer orientation requiresprogram planners to understand and respond toconsumers desires and needs. The social market ing approach seeks ways to design services and SOCIAL MARKETING 1126develop behavioral recommendations that are com patible with consumers values and beliefs.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,662,In con trast to top down expert driven approaches so cial marketing attempts to create interventionsthat enable the target audience to solve prob lems and realize the dreams that people considerimportant. Social marketers believe that the behaviors being promoted should contribute to the consum ers and society s well being. However people mayhave aspirations and desires that work againstsociety s interests or conﬂict with their own healthand well being.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,663,There is a responsibility inherentin health promotion and education to design anddeliver offerings that preserve and enhance socialhealth and marketing techniques do not abrogatethis responsibility they are tools that may helppublic health professionals reach those they needto reach. CONSUMER RESEARCH A consumer orientation requires an examination of consumer perceptions of product beneﬁts prod uct price the competition s beneﬁts and costs andother factors that inﬂuence consumer behavior.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,664,Marketing healthful behaviors relies on the socialand behavioral sciences to guide formative re search and subsequent program design.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,665,Program planners use consumer research ﬁnd ings to identify the factors to address in promotingbehavior change to the people they hope to reach.Drawing on a theoretical framework that com bines elements from the Health Belief Model Social Cognitive Theory the Theory of ReasonedAction and the Trans theoretical Model of Behav ior Change research is designed to identify themix of internal and external factors that have thegreatest impact on people s health behavior.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,666,Thebehavioral orientation helps keep program plan ners on track by setting behavioral objectives forprogram interventions and designing strategiesthat address the critical factors that determine aspeciﬁc audience segment s adoption of the de sired behavior. Research also helps program plan ners determine the speciﬁed behavioral recom mendations that are most likely to be adopted byspeciﬁc segments in the target population.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,667,Con sumer research conducted to develop the Loving Support Makes Breastfeeding Work program for the National WIC Breastfeeding Promotion projectrevealed that families place a strong value on establishing a close loving bond with their babies.While health concerns are also important theemotional beneﬁts associated with breastfeedingare paramount for pregnant women and theirrelatives.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,668,This knowledge helped program plan ners avoid the common mistake of promotingbreastfeeding as a wise medical choice instead of away to realize parents dreams of creating of strongfamily bonds. Research also learned that recom mendations to breastfeed for thirteen months orlonger was not viewed as realistic by many WICparticipants.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,669,Program planners were careful toavoid recommending a speciﬁc time period in aneffort to motivate mothers who doubted theirability to breastfeed for more than a few months.This approach helped foster successful lactationinitiation which subsequently helps instill as senseof pride efﬁcacy to breastfeed for even short peri ods of time. AUDIENCE SEGMENTATION Another distinguishing feature of social market ing is audience segmentation.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,670,Audience segmen tation is the process of dividing a population intodistinct groups based on characteristics that inﬂu ence their responsiveness to interventions. Seg mentation may be used to identify subgroups theycan realistically be reached with available resourcesor to determine the best way to reach particulargroups.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,671,Segments may differ in terms of the bene ﬁts they ﬁnd most attractive the price they arewilling to pay the best place to communicate withthem or to locate services or their differentialresponsiveness to promotional tactics. CONTINUOUS MONITORING AND REVISION Social marketing also relies on continuous pro gram monitoring to assess program efﬁcacy inencouraging the desired behavior changes.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,672,Moni toring also aids in identifying activities that areeffective and those that are not and in makingmidcourse corrections in program interventions.Many public health programs rely on process andimpact evaluations to identify components thatare working and those that should be discon tinued and social marketing devotes consider able resources to this activity.

Quantitative studiesof mortality in England show that for example the average age of death in Liverpool in 1840 was35 for gentry and professional persons and theirfamilies 24 for tradesmen and their families and15 for laborers mechanics servants and theirfamilies.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,682,In Manchester the corresponding ageswere 38 20 and 17 and in Leeds they were 44 27 and 19. In France Louis René Villerme 1782 1863 studied mortality rates in the districts of Paris.During the years 1817 to 1821 the average annualmortality rate ranged from 22 deaths per 1000inhabitants in the richest district to 42 deaths per1000 inhabitants in the poorest.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,683,Findings such as these led the great patholo gist Rudolf Virchow 1821 1902 together withhis colleagues in the German Medical Reformmovement of 1848 to enunciate the basic princi ples of social medicine 1. The health of the people is a matter of direct social concern. 2. Social and economic conditions have an important effect on health and disease and these relations must be subjected toscientiﬁc investigation. 3.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,684,Steps must be taken to promote health and to combat disease and the measuresinvolved in such action must be social aswell as medical. These basic concepts of social medicine were extensively developed in the ﬁrst half of the twenti eth century in continental Europe. After World War II a strong movement for social medicine developed in the United Kingdom.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,685,In the UnitedStates a broad concept of social medicine wasdeveloped by the economist and public healthstatistician Edgar Sydenstricker the sociologistBernhard J. Stern the public health scientist C. E. A. Winslow and the medical historian Henry E.Sigerist. However the term was not adopted byAmerican medical schools because of the conser vative views of the medical profession.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,686,On the other hand the term social medicine is now in the process of being replaced because it istoo limiting the ﬁeld encompasses a variety ofprofessional disciplines other than medicine andthe term public health is becoming increasingly recognized as more accurate.

SOCIAL NETWORKS AND SOCIAL SUPPORT It is widely recognized that social relationships and afﬁliations have powerful effects on physical andmental health. Although many social scientistsfrom Emile Durkheim on have written about thecritical role of social relationships in health out comes it was not until the 1970s that epide miologists turned their attention to this issue. In the ﬁrst of these studies in Alameda County California Berkman et al.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,689,1979 men and womenwho lacked ties to others were 1.9 to 3.1 timesmore likely to die than those who had many con tacts. A 1982 study in Tecumseh Michigan Houseet al. 1982 showed a similar association for men but not for women between social connectednessand participation and mortality risk. In the sameyear D. Blazer reported similar results from asample of elderly men and women in DurhamCounty North Carolina. Schoenbach et al.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,690,1986 in a study in Evans County Georgia used a measure of contacts modi ﬁed from the Alameda County study and found SOCIAL NETWORKS AND SOCIAL SUPPORT 1129risks to be signiﬁcant in older white men and women even when controlling for risk factors although some racial and gender differences wereobserved. In Sweden the Goteborg study Welinet al. 1985 showed that in different cohorts ofmen social isolation proved to be a risk factor fordying independent of biomedical risk factors.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,691,A1987 report by Orth Gomér and Johnson reportedsigniﬁcantly increased risks for men and womenwho have been socially isolated. Finally in a studyof men and women in eastern Finland Kaplan andassociates 1988 demonstrated that an index ofsocial connections predicts mortality risk for menbut not for women independent of cardiovascularrisk factors.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,692,Several more recent studies including the Established Populations for the EpidemiologicStudy of the Elderly EPESE studies conﬁrm thecontinued importance of social relationships intolate life. Furthermore studies of large cohorts ofmen and women in a large health maintenanceorganization Vogt et al. 1992 and male healthprofessionals Kawachi et al. 1996 suggest thatsocial networks are in general more stronglyrelated to mortality than to the incidence of dis ease. Studies in Danish men Pennix et al.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,693,1997 and Japanese men and women Sugisawa et al. 1994 also indicate that social isolation and socialsupport are related to mortality. Social networksand support have been found to predict a broadarray of health outcomes from survival after heartattacks to disease progression functioning andthe onset and course of infectious diseases.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,694,UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM APPROACHES Conceptually social networks are embedded in a macrosocial environment in which large scale so cial forces may inﬂuence network structure whichin turn inﬂuences a cascading causal process. Seri ous consideration of the larger macrosocial con text in which networks form and are sustained isalmost completely absent and such considerationis needed in studies of social network inﬂuenceson health.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,695,Networks may operate through at least ﬁve primary pathways 1 provision of social support 2 social inﬂuence 3 social engagement 4 person to person contact and 5 access to re sources and material goods.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,696,These psychosocialand behavioral processes may inﬂuence even moreproximate pathways to health status includingdirect physiological stress responses psychologi cal states and traits health damaging or health promoting behaviors such as tobacco consump tion or physical activity and exposure to infectiousdisease agents. Most obviously the structure of network ties inﬂuences health via the provision of social sup port. This framework immediately acknowledgesthat not all ties are supportive.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,697,Social support istypically divided into subtypes including emo tional instrumental appraisal and informationalsupport. Perhaps even more important than social sup port are the ways in which social relationshipsprovide a basis for intimacy and attachment. Inti macy and attachment have meaning not only forrelationships that traditionally are thought of asintimate e.g. between partners between parentsand children but for more extended ties.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,698,Forinstance when relationships are solid at a commu nity level individuals feel strong bonds and attach ment to places e.g. a neighborhood and organi zations e.g. voluntary and religious organizations . Social networks may also inﬂuence health via social inﬂuence. Shared norms about health be haviors e.g. alcohol and cigarette consumption treatment adherence might be powerful sourcesof social inﬂuence with direct consequences forthe behaviors of network members.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,699,A third and more difﬁcult to deﬁne pathway by which networks may inﬂuence health status isby promoting social participation and social en gagement. Getting together with friends attend ing social functions group recreation and churchattendance are all instances of social engagement.Several studies suggest that social engagement iscritical in maintaining cognitive ability Bassuk etal. 1999 and reducing mortality Glass et al. 2000 .
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,700,Another pathway by which networks inﬂuence disease is by restricting or promoting exposure toinfectious disease agents through person to personcontact. What is perhaps most remarkable is thatthe same network characteristics that can be health promoting can at the same time be health damaging SOCIAL NETWORKS AND SOCIAL SUPPORT 1130if they serve as vectors for the spread of infectious disease.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,701,Little research has sought to examine differ ential access to material goods resources andservices as a mechanism through which social net works might operate. This is unfortunate giventhe existing work showing that social networksoperate by regulating an individual s access to lifeopportunities by virtue of the extent to whichnetworks overlap with other networks. In this way networks operate to provide access or to restrictopportunities in much the same way that socialstatus does.

The driving force behind the founding ofSOT was the lack of recognition being given totoxicologists by pharmacologists.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,717,The toxicolo gists were primarily involved in the safety assess ment of chemicals and drugs and they had adifﬁcult time publishing their results. The toxi cologists had a forum in the Gordon Research Conferences that initiated a series of conferenceson toxicology and safety evaluation in 1954.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,718,Theattendees of these conferences and especially itsearly chairs developed the concept of the SOT as aprofessional and learned scientiﬁc organization.In 1959 they held a small meeting to bring thesociety into being and between 1959 and 1961 thefounding members were selected. Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology the ﬁrst American journal dedicated to toxicology and the original journalof the Society and edited by Harry Hayes FredrickCoulston and Arnold Lehman was published.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,719,Many of the founders of the SOT were col leagues students and collaborators of ProfessorE. M. K. Geiling who is credited by many as thefather of modern toxicology. Drs. Kenneth DuBois the ﬁrst president of the SOT Geiling andFrances Kelsey published their Textbook of Toxicol ogy in 1959.

The predominanttheories stem from the work of Karl Marx EmileDurkheim Max Weber Talcott Parsons RobertMerton and James Coleman. The inﬂuence of thisrich theoretical foundation has manifested itself inmajor debates over the role of sociology as ascience.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,724,European and American perspectives onsociology as a science differ with the Americanperspective favoring sociology as a scientiﬁc disci pline and emphasizing a more quantitative meth odological approach than the European approach. KEY CONCEPTS IN SOCIOLOGY Several key concepts in sociology relate to its role in public health. Foremost is the emphasis onsociety rather than the individual. The individualis viewed as an actor within larger social processes.This distinguishes the ﬁeld from psychology.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,725,Theemphasis is on units of analysis at the collectivelevel such as the family the group the neighbor hood the city the organization the state and theworld. Of key importance is how the social fabric or social structure is maintained and how socialprocesses such as conﬂict and resolution relate tothe maintenance and change of social structures.A sociologist studies processes that create main tain and sustain a social system such as a health care system in a particular country.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,726,The scientiﬁccomponent of this study would be the concernwith the processes regulating and shaping thehealth care system. Sociology assumes that socialstructure and social processes are very complex.Therefore its methodology is appropriately com plex and often particularly in American sociology dominated by multivariate statistical methods ofanalysis.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,727,The advent of the computer in the secondhalf of the twentieth century presented the ﬁeldwith the opportunity to work with very large bod ies of data and complex variables. MEDICAL SOCIOLOGY Earlier social theorists such as those noted above did write on subjects of concern to medicine health and illness but medical sociology as asubdiscipline of sociology developed in the post World War II period.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,728,Early debates in medicalsociology were concerned with the role of sociol ogy as it relates to medicine Should the ﬁeld becritical and analytical concerning itself with thesociology of medicine i.e. examining how medi cine works or should it be largely applied focus ing on sociology as a handmaiden for medicine Like many such formative debates there could beno conclusive answer.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,729,However the ﬁeld has de veloped into two groups those largely withinacademic settings which focus on the sociology ofmedicine and those primarily in schools of publichealth and governmental institutions which focuson the application of sociology to medicine. Laterdebates related to whether the focus should be onhealth sociology or medical sociology. This debatehas moved the ﬁeld to a broader more ecological view of medicine and health.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,730,SOCIOLOGY IN PUBLIC HEALTH Public health has been and remains a very applied ﬁeld. It is also characterized by a population based SOCIOLOGY IN PUBLIC HEALTH 1133approach to health and statistical methods are deemed the appropriate underlying method forthe ﬁeld. It is viewed as a science that seeks tointervene control and prevent large scale proc esses that negatively affect the public s health.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,731,Bythese criteria there is a strong logical ﬁt of socio logical principles and practices within public health.Nonetheless sociology has not been the key so cial science discipline in public health. That posi tion has gone to psychology where the emphasison individual behavior resonates more with abiomedical model.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,732,Despite this many of the pri mary concerns of present day public health withlarge scale variables such as social capital socialinequality social status and health care organiza tion and ﬁnancing remain topics best suited to thesociological perspective and methodology. Theemphasis in public health is thus shifting toward asociological perspective. SOCIOLOGICAL CONCEPTS IN PUBLIC HEALTH Sociology in public health is reﬂected in the myr iad of sociological concepts that pervade the prac tice of public health.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,733,More than any other socialscience sociology has the discussion of socioeco nomic status at its very core. Social class variationwithin society is the key explanatory variable insociology for everything from variation in socialstructure to differential life experiences of healthand illness.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,734,Indeed there appears to be over whelming evidence that Western industrializedsocieties that have little variation in social classexperience have far better health outcomes thansocieties characterized by wide social class disper sion. In short inequalities in health are directlyrelated to social and economic inequalities. Muchof later twentieth century public health is devotedto the reduction of these inequalities.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,735,SOCIOLOGICAL METHODS IN PUBLIC HEALTH Methodological concerns are critical to sociologi cal research. The great debate in sociology hasbeen on the relative merits and role of quantitativeversus qualitative approaches. Both approachesare widely used and play a critical role for publichealth. Sociology has long recognized that thesocial world comprises both an objective and asubjective reality.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,736,For example the objective real ity of having cancer is accompanied by the subjec tive reality of the experience of cancer by thepatient and the patient s family and friends.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,737,Bothrealities are relevant to the sociological approach.The subjective qualitative approach is generallydiscussed in the theory and methods concernedwith illness behavior but qualitative approachesare equally applicable to the understanding ofsocial policy world systems and areas of sociologywhere statistical measurement is difﬁcult or lessrelevant. Within public health surveillance is seen as a key approach to describing the distribution anddynamics of disease.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,738,In sociological approaches topublic health the role of social and behavioralfactors in health and illness is central. Surveymethodology has occupied a central place in socio logical research since the middle of the twentiethcentury. The concern has been with the collection management analysis interpretation and use oflarge quantities of data obtained by direct inter view with respondents.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,739,Social surveys are charac terized by large random samples complicated ques tionnaires and the use of multivariate statistics foranalysis. By their very nature most sociologicalvariables are complex to measure and to analyze.For example the assessment of socioeconomicstatus of an individual requires the accurate meas urement of several variables that sit within a largersocial context.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,740,Socioeconomic status SES is re garded as a product of several components in cluding income residence education and occu pation. Determining the relative weight of each ofthese components is a major analytical problem.Thus when considering the role of socioeconomicstatus on health care outcomes there is no easyanswer to what mechanism actually works to deter mine the observed relationship between SESand health.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,741,SOCIOLOGY AND EVALUATION IN PUBLIC HEALTH Because many sociological variables are at the so called macro level there is limited opportunity tointervene rapidly directly or simply. For example the SES of a group is affected by complex compo nents such as education and occupation that arepart of the total life course of individuals within SPAN OF LIFE 1134the group. Thus to change the SES of a group would require signiﬁcant redistribution of resourcesof the larger social structure.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,742,A signiﬁcant periodof time and concerted effort is needed to changesuch macro variables. This is however not dissimi lar to many other challenges in public health suchas the long term and time consuming effort tochange lifestyles and reduce behavioral risk fac tors related to chronic diseases. The chief role of sociology in public health remains its evaluation of those macro componentsof society that affect public health at the popula tion level.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,743,Such evaluations provide an under standing of why inequalities in health exist andthey help elaborate upon the mechanisms andprocesses that sustain these inequalities. This re lates to the long standing theoretical concern withsocial structure among sociologists.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,744,Further soci ology reveals the mechanisms for long term changesthat may lead to a reduction in health inequalities.The product of sociological thinking in publichealth is not immediate nor easily understood bythose who seek quick and easy solutions to thesuffering of humanity. Nonetheless the long termrole of sociology in public health is to change andimprove the public health.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,747,Theappearance of new life forms depends upon theavailability of diverse habitats relative stability ofclimatic regimes and processes that allow geneticand behavioral modiﬁcation to in effect isolatenew life forms from a common ancestor. Whentwo populations can no longer interbreed forwhatever reason they assume the status of sepa rate species or subspecies.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,748,Historically processesleading to the loss of life forms have been relatedto changes in biophysical conditions such as par ticularly rapid changes in climate. Of course it isseldom clear exactly what the causes of extinctionare. Species extinction could arise from a combi nation of factors changes in ecology loss of criti cal habitat pollution overharvesting or competi tion from an exotic nonnative species that isintroduced into the ecosystem.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,749,CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES The consequences of loss of species for ecosystem function depends upon the role played in theecosystem by the species or group of species andby the degree to which those roles are or could beassumed by other biotic components of the ecosys tem. In general the loss of a species in an ecosys tem with naturally low species diversity is likely tohave a larger consequence than the loss of a spe cies in a more complex environment characterizedby high species richness.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,750,There have been numer ous theoretical and empirical investigations thathave sought to validate this simple proposition.Unfortunately owing to the natural complexityand diversity of ecosystems within the biosphere no hard and fast rule on the consequences of theloss of species richness on ecosystem function hasyet been accepted as above reproach. What appears much clearer is the impact of human activity on species loss and acceleratingspecies loss worldwide.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,751,There is a close parallelbetween early human migrations and the disap pearance of large game species. Overexploitation SPECIES EXTINCTION 1135of biological resources has continued to the pres ent time and numerous species have disappearedin regional environments as a consequence. Forexample the combination of overharvesting pollu tion and habitat loss owing to shoreline restruc turing had much to do with the disappearance ofthe sturgeon lake trout and many other preferredspecies in the lower Great Lakes.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,752,The introduc tion of exotic species such as the sea lamprey isalso a factor. Of greatest concern at the beginningof the twenty ﬁrst century is the potential forwholesale loss of species in some twenty ﬁve hotspots around the world as a consequence largelyof habitat modiﬁcations e.g. clearing tropicalforests for agriculture construction of large dams . Biodiversity loss is one of the most consistent signs of ecosystem distress syndrome EDS .
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,753,Esti mates range widely but generally current esti mates of species losses are ten fold to one thou sand fold greater than historic levels leading someto speculate that the earth is already entering aperiod of the sixth major extinction of life on theplanet. This extinction however differs from therest in that the primary cause appears to be theeffects of human activity. Humans appropriatemore than 50 percent of global primary productiv ity.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,754,They have also altered the chemical composi tion of the atmosphere triggering climate change which in turn destabilizes ecological balance. IMPLICATIONS FOR HUMAN HEALTH Humans as part of the web of life are not immune to events that trigger the extinction of organismson the profound scale that appears to be currentlytaking place and the implications for human healthare numerous and diverse.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,755,Firstly there are direct effects for example the loss of marine ﬁsheries over 70 percent of themajor commercially ﬁshed marine stocks areoverexploited and in decline translates for manycommunities into a loss of reliable food supplies.This contributes to malnutrition a rising prob lem particularly in developing countries wherean estimated two billion people approximatelyone third of the global population presently suf fers from lack of adequate diet.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,756,Malnutrition re duces the longevity of a population both directlyand indirectly by weakening the immune system which renders the population more susceptible todiseases. Another direct impact is the loss of po tential biological materials that are useful as medi cines both in traditional medicines and as ingredi ents in modern pharmacology. The loss of theinventory of biotic resources for medicinal pur poses directly threatens human health.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,757,Finally there is the loss of economic opportunity and theloss of social cohesion that often accompanies a degrading environment. An impoverished socioe conomic condition generally is associated with ahost of health threats including substance abuseand violence. Indirect effects are more difﬁcult to pin down.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,758,Clearly the loss of a signiﬁcant portion of thespecies that inhabit a particular ecosystem hasmajor implications for ecosystem functioning in cluding the provision of ecosystem services suchas production of food regulation of hydrology and pollination that form part of the life supportsystem for humans and other species.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,759,Degradationof such environments through human activities with a subsequent loss of species components poses a host of threats to human health throughthe loss of critical ecosystem functions. Loss of diversity of pathogens poses an en tirely different set of issues. The history of Euro pean settlement in the Great Lakes is also a historyof purposeful drainage of swamps and wetlandsalong the southwest shore of Lake Ontario in aneffort largely successful to eliminate the mos quito vectors of malaria.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,760,In many parts of theworld today eradication of pathogens is part of apublic health strategy which in addition to theintended consequences also degrades ecosystems.Worldwide there has been a successful eradica tion of the smallpox virus. At the same time thewidespread use of antibiotics and pesticides iscreating resistant strains not new species of patho gens and crop pests thus contributing to an in crease in genetic biodiversity.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,767,Although often presented inepidemiologic textbooks as a separate technique it is in fact a speciﬁc application of the generalmethods to control for confounding factors. Assuch many of the issues related to confoundingand methods used to adjust for confounding canbe applied to standardization. Historically theneed for age standardization was recognized wellbefore the general concept of confounding wasformalized.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,768,It has it roots in the earliest epidemio logical studies the ﬁrst known reference to agestandardization appeared in a publication by F. G. P.Neison in 1844. The most familiar application is inthe presentation of age standardized mortality orcancer incidence rates to explore temporal trends. Two major approaches to standardization have been used direct and indirect. Direct standardiza tion is used when the study population is largeenough that age speciﬁc rates within the popula tion are stable.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,769,When the population is small orthe outcome is rare the number of events ob served can be small. In that circumstance indirectstandardization methods can be used to produce astandardized mortality rate SMR or a standard ized incidence rate SIR . Direct standardization is commonly used in reports of vital statistics e.g. mortality or diseaseincidence trends e.g. cancer incidence .
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,770,Indirectstandardization has a played a major role in studiesof occupational disease or studies of place andtime limited environmental catastrophes. Indirectstandardization was introduced as a tool beforedirect standardization 1844 vs. 1899 . The standard approach to explaining stan dardization involves the concepts of expected and observed counts.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,771,In direct standardization oneestimates the rate that would have been observed if STANDARDIZATION OF RATES 1137Table 1 Age Mortality ReferenceExpected Group cases deaths rate Population deaths 40 49 3 734 37 0.0099 1 000 000 9 900 50 59 1 887 94 0.0498 600 000 29 880 60 69 1 645 327 0.1988 200 000 39 760 Total 7 266 458 0.0630 1 800 000 79 540Number ofNumber of numberDirect Age Standardization SOURCE Courtesy of author. the study population had had the same age struc ture as the reference group e.g.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,772,the number ofcases of disease that would be expected if thedisease rates in the study population were appliedto the reference population . In indirect standardi zation one computes the number of cases ofdisease that would have been expected if the dis ease rates from the reference population had ap plied in the study population. Dividing the ob served case count by the expected count yields theSMR.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,773,A more modern approach to standardiza tion recognizes that these methods are computingweighted averages of the age speciﬁc rates. To perform a direct age standardization one ﬁrst has to select a reference population. Thispopulation is arbitrary although conventionallyone uses either the World Standard Populationproduced by the World Health Organization or acensus population count for the country in whichthe work is being conducted. Next one computesthe age speciﬁc rates within the study group.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,774,Then one multiplies these rates by the number of peoplein that age group in the reference population.These expected counts are summed and dividedby the total population size of the reference popu lation to yield the directly standardized rate. Thisis illustrated in the example shown in Table 1. Thecrude mortality rate is 63 1 000.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,775,Standardizing tothe reference population gives an age adjustedmortality rate of 79 540 1 800 000 44 1 000.The adjusted rate is lower than the crude rate issince the proportion of the reference populationin the oldest age group 11 which has thehighest age speciﬁc mortality rate is only 50 per cent of that found in the study population 22 .This adjusted rate can be directly compared toTable 2 Mortality rate Age in Reference Group cases deaths population deaths 40 49 3 734 37 0.005 18.7 50 59 1 887 94 0.02 37.7 60 69 1 645 327 0.1 164.5 Total 7 266 458 0.0630 220.9 SOURCE Courtesy of author.Expected Number of numberNumber ofIndirect Age Standardization adjusted rates from other years to detect trends in mortality.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,776,Indirect standardization uses the reference population to provide age speciﬁc rates. Withineach age stratum one multiplies the reference rateby the number of people in the study populationto determine the number of cases that would havebeen expected if that were the rate in the studygroup. These expected numbers are added upacross all age groups and divided into the observednumber to yield the SMR.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,777,Values greater than 1 or 100 as the SMR is commonly expressed multi plied by 100 indicate a higher mortality thanexpected. It is possible to compute an indirectlystandardized rate but this is much less commonthan SMR SIRs. Unlike directly standardized rates one can not compare SMRs across time or place.One can however compare SMRs for differentoutcomes within the same study population. Thisis a signiﬁcant limitation to the use of SMRs. In theexample given in Table 2 the researcher observed458 deaths.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,778,However based on the age speciﬁcrates in the reference population only 221 deathswould have been expected yielding an SMR of2.07 or 207 suggesting a higher mortality ratein the study population than in the referencepopulation. The use of standardized rates is controversial. Any summary measure can hide patterns that mighthave important public health implications. Forexample with age standardization one might failto detect age speciﬁc differences in risk acrosstime or place.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,779,This might arise if a disease isdisplaying an increasing incidence due to a birthcohort effect people at younger ages might have a STAPHYLOCOCCAL INFECTION 1138higher risk in recent years compared to previous years while older people could have the oppositepattern . An age standardized rate could hide thesetrends. Despite this risk standardized rates havebeen found to provide useful summary measures especially when outcomes are rare and speciﬁcrates display wide random variability.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,780,One of the biggest potential abuses of stan dardized rates is by health care planners who usethe standardized rates to estimate demand forservices. This is incorrect practice. The standard ized rate reﬂects the number of new cases thatwould arise in a hypothetical population. Theactual number of cases expected is given by thecrude rate which should always be employed inhealth care planning analyses.

Sanitary and social reform provided the basis for the formation of publichealth organizations p.62 . Baltimore Maryland established the ﬁrst city health department in 1798. In general city healthdepartments were established before state healthdepartments and well before county health de partments.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,790,State health agencies developed ﬁrst inMassachusetts and then across the country duringthe latter half of the nineteenth century. As Ameri can ambivalence about government gave way to adesire for the beneﬁts that local government inter vention could provide to the public through sani tation and control of communicable disease sev eral more health departments were formed in theﬁrst half of the twentieth century.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,791,In 1953 JosephMountin reported that there were 1 239 local healthdepartments in the United States. By 2000 therewere state health agencies in every state and ap proximately 2 832 local health departments na tionwide. The state health departments and manyof the local health departments were developedand have evolved independently.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,793,A unit of state governmentthat matches this broad deﬁnition exists in each ofthe nation s ﬁfty states. The National Associationof County and City Health Ofﬁcials NACCHO in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Con trol and Prevention CDC deﬁnes a local healthdepartment as an administrative or service unit oflocal or state government concerned with health and carrying some responsibility for the health of ajurisdiction smaller than the state.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,794,This deﬁnitionis very broad and is intended to be inclusive ofunits that vary in size including local service unitsof a state health department. However the deﬁni tion does not take into consideration organiza tional capacity to perform basic or essential ser vices. Units of local government that have healthdepartments include cities towns and counties or equivalents and there are combinations suchas city county and multiple county. Not all units oflocal government have health departments.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,795,RESPONSIBILITIES AND ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE National standards or guidelines do not exist to delineate speciﬁc responsibilities for state andlocal health departments and there is a widedegree of variation in their roles across the coun try. As suggested previously some state healthdepartments perform both state and local roles.

In about one quarter of the states STATE AND LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS 1141nearly all of the local agencies are units of state government and are accountable to the state healthdepartment director. Even in these cases how ever the local health departments serving thelarger cities is often locally governed.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,809,Finally NativeAmericans living on reservations are usually servedby tribal health departments governed by tribalgovernments. In some states signiﬁcant portions of the population are not served by local public healthservices. Only one state Rhode Island has no localhealth departments.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,810,A number of counties in somestates have no local health department presence.Other parts of the country such as certain areaswithin Massachusetts and Connecticut are servedprincipally by very small local health departmentswith few employees and very little capacity. In atleast one state Pennsylvania a few cities and or counties are served by local health departments while the majority of counties are served by smallregional ofﬁces of the state health department.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,811,InNew Jersey the city town and an array of countyand regional health departments provide servicesthrough the hundreds of separate boards of healthrepresenting each municipality in the state. Tofurther complicate this conﬁguration there existsautonomous municipal level health departmentsfunctioning separately within the counties wherecounty health departments operate.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,812,This confusing and inconsistent organization of local public health services is strong evidencethat the nation s local public health infrastructureis weak. The lack of uniform protection of thecountry s citizens from outbreaks of infectiousdiseases and other hazards represents potential harm to all residents.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,813,In the late 1990s this state ofaffairs led to the development of national per formance standards to congressional considera tion of public health infrastructure needs and toconsideration of alternative methods of providinglocal public health services. There are two major barriers to implementing signiﬁcant improvements in the local public healthsystem disagreement about the relative impor tance of local control versus meaningful capacity and availability of public resources.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,814,Some commu nities and states continue to operate under a tradi tion that places emphasis on local governance ofoperations rather than efﬁciency and service ca pacity. Other states have chosen to regionalizeservices or to share resources in order to achieve the capacity to provide essential services. Localofﬁces of regional multicounty health districts for example serve all counties in the state ofIdaho.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,815,Multiple county public health districts areemployed to a signiﬁcant degree in Michigan Washington and Utah as well. In some states there is a signiﬁcant level of resource sharingamong smaller health departments e.g. sharinghealth ofﬁcers or administrators in Oklahoma andWashington . FUNDING MECHANISMS State and local health departments receive their funding primarily from governmental sources.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,816,In1997 sources of the funds expended by statehealth departments included state funds 55 per cent federal funds 30 percent and a variety ofmiscellaneous revenue sources 15 percent . Amonglocal health departments in 1995 46 percent oftotal funds came from state and federal sources 34percent from local sources and 10 percent fromMedicare and Medicaid with fees and other sourcesaccounting for the rest. Public health accounts for very little of the nation s overall health budget.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,817,The overwhelmingmajority of health care dollars are directed to thetreatment of illness and injuries and particularlyto those who are in their last year of life. Very littlegoes to prevention. Total health expenditures inthe United States for 1991 were 752 billion.Expenditures by state health agencies and localhealth departments in that year represented only1.9 percent of all health spending.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,818,Discontinua tion of a reporting system in the early 1990s elimi nated collection of state and local public healthexpenditure data. Consequently more recent datais not available. For comparison purposes 2.6percent of all health spending was attributed tostate and local health departments in 1978. In terms of absolute expenditures 1991 ex penditures of state health agencies were 11.3 billion more than double the level of expenditures in 1982.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,819,The 1991 total included 9.3 billion indirect expenditures and 1.9 billion in transfers tolocal health departments. Total combined stateand local health department expenditures were 14 billion in 1991. Thus although expenditures STATE AND LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS 1142for state and local public health have increased over the past two decades they account for thedeclining proportions of total national healthexpenditures.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,820,Some of the categorical funding streams sup porting state and local health departments havebeen capped and others have decreased. Indeed Congress and state legislatures provide resources for public health programming principally through categorical grants supporting relatively narrow often disease speciﬁc uses of the appropriations.This shifting disease of the year approach to ﬁ nancing public health is difﬁcult to administer leaves large gaps is not tied explicitly to the na tion s objectives e.g.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,821,Healthy People 2010 andlimits the tailoring of programs to match local andstate needs and priorities. In response to theselimitations state and local health departments inmany parts of the country increasingly are lookingto partnerships with foundations businesses andother community organizations to market publichealth and prevention programs address infra structure deﬁciencies and initiate efforts to im prove health status in their communities.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,822,WORKFORCE REQUIREMENTS The workforce employed by state departments of health varies from state to state. In some states political appointees with little or no expertise inpublic health ﬁll the executive positions. In others there is a statutory requirement that physicianswho are board certiﬁed in preventive medicine ﬁllsuch positions.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,823,A typical state department of healthemploys a number of professionals to fulﬁll plan ning data analysis contract compliance epide miology and laboratory functions technical assist ance and other state functions. Typical employeesinclude physicians nurses nurse practitioners dentists veterinarians nutritionists health educa tors planners social workers epidemiologists labo ratory technicians biostatiticians computer tech nicians and communications specialists.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,824,As with state health departments the workforce requirements of local health departments varywidely. The executives of about 35 percent oflocal agencies have medical degrees a few statesstill require that local health directors be licensedphysicians . Other professional positions most com monly found in local health departments includenurses environmental health specialists sanitar ians health educators and nutritionists.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,825,In ad dition larger health departments often employphysicians nurse practitioners epidemiologists dentists dental hygienists social workers out reach workers planners and computer specialists. It has been estimated that between 50 percent and 80 percent of public health workers in stateand local agencies have no formal training in theﬁeld. A number of resources for workforce devel opment have evolved to address this concern.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,826,TheHealth Resources and Services Administration HRSA provides grants for postgraduate studiesand public health residencies. The CDC provides abroad range of training accessible by mail Internet satellite downlinks and on site classes. The num ber of accredited schools of public health rose by20 percent between 1990 and 2000 increasingfrom twenty four to twenty nine schools locatedaround the country. Many have begun providingcontinuing education offerings for public healthprofessionals.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,827,Several offer graduate degrees in public health through courses of study designedfor midcareer workers. In addition in 1999 both CDC and HRSA received funds for training the existing publichealth workforce. In July 2000 HRSA announcedgrants to eight Public Health Training Centers PHTC s which provide assistance to workers in28 states. In September 2000 CDC s four Centersfor Public Health Preparedness CPHPs awardswere announced.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,828,Although the PHTCs and CPHPsare funded separately by the two agencies bothrequire a partnership with an accredited school ofpublic health. Many essential practice skills however are not typically addressed in traditional public healthtraining. Work completed in the late 1990s forexample showed that of public health workersacross the range of professions most needed train ing in leadership communication and manage ment. A number of resources to address theseneeds developed during the 1990s.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,829,For example the Public Health Leadership Institute was estab lished in 1991 through a partnership of Californiauniversities with funding from the CDC. Publichealth workers in nearly every state now haveaccess to smaller state or regionally based leader ship institutes.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,830,In the late 1990s the CDC the STATE AND LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS 1143HRSA the W. K. Kellogg Foundation and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation funded basicmanagement skills training for teams of middleand upper management workers from local healthdepartments. This pilot program is providedthrough the University of North Carolina Schoolof Public Health. CORE FUNCTIONS AND ESSENTIAL SERVICES In 1988 the Institute of Medicine published its landmark report The Future of Public Health .
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,831,This report identiﬁed a number of problems with thepublic health system including an appalling lackof resources a confused mission poor leadership and a prevailing view among policymakers thatpublic health challenges like infectious diseases unsafe food and contaminated drinking waterwere all resolved. The report concluded with itsmost frequently quoted phrase public health is indisarray. The IOM report has contributed signiﬁcantly to the practice of public health.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,832,It proposed asimple but powerful mission statement to fulﬁllsociety s interest in assuring conditions in whichpeople can be healthy p. 17 . The report alsoproposed a more comprehensive operational frame work for governmental public health with theelucidation of three core functions assessment policy development and assurance see Figure 1 .
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,833,The assessment function requires public health agencies to regularly and systematically collect assemble analyze and make available informationon the health of the community including statis tics on health status community health needs andepidemiologic and other studies of health prob lems p. 7 . The report emphasized that thisbasic function of public health cannot be dele gated.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,834,Within a decade of the report s release about 70 percent of local health departments hadcompleted assessments of the communities theyserve. Many have developed fairly sophisticatedsubunits of their organization to conduct assess ment activities on an ongoing basis. A number of assessment tools evolved in the early 1990s.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,835,Those most commonly used throughthe decade included Assessment Protocol for Excel lence in Public Health APEXPH developed bythe National Association of County and City HealthFigure 1 Care Functions of Departments AssessmentAssurance Policy Department SOURCE Courtesy of author. Ofﬁcials in cooperation with the CDC Planned Approach To Community Health PATCH de veloped by the CDC and Model Standards devel oped by the American Public Health Associationand others .
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,836,The second core function policy develop ment was portrayed as what policymakers par ticularly in government do with the results ofassessments. If an assessment deﬁned the prob lems of a community the policy developmentprocess would yield priorities and produce plansto address the problems.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,837,In the words of thereport public health agencies should serve thepublic interest in the development of comprehen sive public health policies by promoting the use ofthe scientiﬁc knowledge base in decision makingabout public health and by leading in developingpublic health policy. Agencies must take a strategicapproach developed on the basis of a positiveappreciation for the democratic political proc ess p. 8 .
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,838,The assurance function called for public health agencies to assure their constituents that servicesnecessary to achieve agreed upon goals are pro vided either by encouraging actions by other enti ties private or public by requiring such action STATE AND LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS 1144through regulation or by providing services di rectly p. 8 . This function might be seen as theimplementation step following policy develop ment.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,839,Thus the three core functions are tightlylinked with one another with assessment leadingto policy development resulting in assurance lead ing again to assessment to evaluate the results andcontinue the process. While the core functions represented a new framework for considering the practice of publichealth the framework was rather sparse in detailand did little to explain the practice to thoseoutside public health.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,840,In 1994 the Public HealthFunctions Steering Committee chaired by theSurgeon General adopted the Ten Essential Pub lic Health Services. While based on the core func tions the more expansive list is more precise indescribing speciﬁc capacities that all levels of gov ernmental public health should have. Development of the core functions and the essential services had a profound impact on thepractice of public health through the 1990s.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,841,State and local health departments have dramaticallyincreased the number and the level of involvementof partners in conducting assessments developingpolicy and in assuring the delivery of services. Insome locales the partnerships have led to innova tion in how services are delivered loosening twolong held perspectives that only public health agen cies can serve the poor and that public health iswhat public health departments do.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,842,Many local and state agencies began placing increased emphasis on population level services inthe mid 1990s. In many instances this resulted incontracts or other arrangements with private sectorproviders to provide personal health services fordisenfranchised populations.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,843,In place of directservice delivery local and state health departmentsincreasingly conducted community assessments developed local and state priorities and plans participated in the development of healthy com munities and addressed such issues as communityviolence prevention injury prevention and safersex practices. In some locales public health hasbeen redeﬁned to mean that which the commu nity does collectively to protect and improve thehealth of its residents.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,844,In such communities therole of the state and local health departments isprincipally to provide ﬁnancial and technical re sources and to convene and guide local process.PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT AND ACCREDITATION The 1990s heralded a call for increased accounta bility of governmental agencies and for greateremphasis on outcomes. Florida developed per formance standards and several other states de veloped standards as a component of statewideaccreditation.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,845,Illinois in conjunction with its IPLANprogram also developed a certiﬁcation system forlocal health departments. In the late 1990s the CDC in partnership with NACCHO the Association of State and TerritorialHealth Ofﬁcials the National Association of LocalBoards of Health the Public Health Foundation and the American Public Health Association con ducted an effort to develop national performancestandards for local and state public health systemsand for standards related to governance.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,846,TheNational Public Health Performance StandardsProgram NPHPSP is based on three principles 1 public health must be accountable to its con stituencies 2 public health professionals need asystem for ensuring that the provision of essentialpublic health services meets a deﬁned level ofquality and 3 the public health decision makingprocess must be based on strong scientiﬁc evi dence. The standards use the essential services ascategories of services.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,847,By early 2000 this programwas still in its infancy and the standards werebeing tested in several states. The objective was toimplement the program nationally on a voluntarybasis early in the ﬁrst decade of the twenty ﬁrstcentury. By the end of the twentieth century public health leaders were having serious discussions aboutthe need for accreditation of state and local healthdepartments.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,848,Some pointed out that public healthis the last health arena with no accreditation avail able and that some form of accreditation is neededto assure quality and accountability. Others ex pressed concerns about the feasibility of accredita tion given the huge diversity in organizationalcapacity and jurisdictional structures. It is clearthat the discussions will continue and that theNPHPSP will likely serve as the basis for an accred itation system should one evolve.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,849,Many people have decried the lack of a certiﬁ cation program for public health workers particu larly in light of the small percentage of the workforcethat has had formal training in public health. STATE PROGRAMS IN TOBACCO CONTROL 1145While some of the speciﬁc professions compris ing the public health workforce have their ownlicensure or certiﬁcation e.g.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,850,MDs RNs regis tered sanitarians none necessarily assure or con tribute to overarching public health competency.Efforts to explore the potential for this type ofcertiﬁcation were beginning in January 2000.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,854,STATE PROGRAMS IN TOBACCO CONTROL The goal of state or provincial tobacco control programs is to reduce the death and disease causedby tobacco use the single most preventable cause of death and disease in developed societies.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,855,Annu ally tobacco use causes more than 400 000 deathsin the United States at a cost of approximately 50billion to 73 billion in medical expenses alone.Comprehensive tobacco control programs com bine a variety of strategies and tactics to preventthe initiation of tobacco use to promote smokingcessation to protect the nonsmoker from environ mental tobacco smoke ETS and to identify andeliminate disparities in tobacco use and diseaseamong different population groups.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,856,The Centersfor Disease Control and Prevention CDC recom mends that state tobacco control programs be com prehensive sustainable and accountable. The term tobacco control has come to mean both thecontrol and the prevention of tobacco use andincludes all forms of tobacco. State tobacco control programs underwent an evolution during the 1990s.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,857,Prior to 1990 stateprograms focused on individual cessation pro grams offered in group settings dissemination ofself help materials for quitting and the distribu tion of information via public service campaigns.During the 1990s state tobacco control programsshifted away from the provision of education andservices as a means to achieve individual behav ioral change.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,858,The next generation of programswas designed to impact whole populations by ad dressing political social and environmental fac tors that support the use or nonuse of tobacco.This also marked a shift away from a focus onindividual responsibility for tobacco use to docu menting and exposing tobacco industry tactics tomarket their product. The tobacco industry spendsan estimated 5 billion annually in advertising andpromotion aimed at sustaining or increasing to bacco use in the United States.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,859,California led this evolution when in 1988 voters passed Proposition 99 which raised thetobacco excise tax by twenty ﬁve cents and dedi cated approximately 90 million annually for to bacco control. The California program initiated astatewide social change to indirectly inﬂuence cur rent and potential future tobacco users by creatinga social milieu and legal climate in which tobaccowas less desirable less acceptable and less accessi ble.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,860,The state tobacco control program did this inpart by implementing an unprecedented hard hitting media campaign that placed responsibilityfor the problem of tobacco use on the shoulders of STATE PROGRAMS IN TOBACCO CONTROL 1146the tobacco industry. While the program was in tended to prevent individuals from suffering thehealth consequences of smoking the programmade it clear that this could not be achievedwithout holding the tobacco industry accountablefor its actions and the products it sold.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,861,In the1990s Massachusetts Arizona and Oregon passedvoter referendums earmarking increases in the taxon tobacco products for comprehensive tobacco control programs. In addition to implementing hard hitting me dia campaigns these states focused on changingnorms regarding tobacco use at the communitylevel through the support of local coalitions.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,862,In1991 the National Cancer Institute partnered withthe American Cancer Society to launch the Ameri can Stop Smoking Intervention Study ASSIST .ASSIST s goal was to build a capacity within seven teen health departments to prevent and reduce tobacco use primarily through the application ofpolicy based approaches that would alter the so ciopolitical environment.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,863,Interventions includedmedia advocacy to increase pro tobacco controlmedia coverage strengthening support for cleanindoor air laws reducing youth access to tobaccoproducts limiting tobacco advertising and promo tion increasing tobacco taxes and increasing thedemand for smoking cessation services. In 1993 the CDC Ofﬁce on Smoking and Health OSH established funding for state basedprograms for the District of Columbia and thethirty two states that were not part of the ASSISTproject.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,864,CDC funding provided state health de partments with a core capacity to create a nucleusof trained staff to conduct assessments and collectdata to develop program plans and to establishcoalitions and partnerships that later would beinstrumental in implementing tobacco control pro grams. At the conclusion of the ASSIST project in 1999 the CDC established the National To bacco Control Program which provides approxi mately 57 million annually in funding to the ﬁftystates.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,865,The National Tobacco Control Programsupports the implementation of several programelements including community interventions coun ter marketing program policy and evaluation andsurveillance. These program elements combine toachieve changes in the four goal areas.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,866,In 1999 the CDC issued Best Practices for Com prehensive Tobacco Control Programs which drewupon evidence from the analyses of the past dec ade s comprehensive state tobacco control pro grams to support nine speciﬁc elements of a com prehensive program.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,867,CDC recommends that statesestablish tobacco control programs that containthe following elements Community programs to reduce tobacco use Chronic disease programs to reduce the burden of tobacco related disease School programs Enforcement Statewide programs Counter marketing Cessation programs Surveillance and evaluation Administration and management Approximate annual costs to implement all of the recommended program components have beenestimated to range from 7 to 20 per capita insmall states population under 3 million 6 to 17 per capita in medium sized states population3 million to 7 million and 5 to 16 per capita inlarger states population over 7 million .
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,868,Three other publications have summarized the results from comprehensive state tobacco control programs. The Institute of Medicine National Research Council report State Programs Can Reduce Tobacco Use 2000 concluded that state programs can make a difference.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,869,In 2000 Surgeon General David Satcher released the ﬁrst ever Sur geon General s Report on the effectiveness ofvarious methods to reduce tobacco use educa tional clinical regulatory economic and social.The report offers a science based blueprint forachieving the Healthy People 2010 objectives to reduce tobacco use and its health impact. Also in2000 the Task Force on Community PreventiveServices released a report and recommendationson strategies to reduce exposure to ETS and toincrease smoking cessation.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,870,The evidence that state comprehensive to bacco control programs work is demonstrated by Major reductions in the consumption of tobacco STATE PROGRAMS IN TOBACCO CONTROL 1147 Reduction in the prevalence of tobacco use Increases in medical coverage for cessation efforts Declines in the initiation of tobacco use A growing number of places that are 100 percent smoke free Declines in the illegal sale of tobacco Greater restrictions on the promotion and marketing of tobacco Additional regulation of tobacco products Increase in the price of tobacco products The states that have implemented tobacco control programs have achieved varying degreesof these outcomes as well as others depending onamount of funding and length of time neces sary to implement programs.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,871,After a decade ofimplementing California s programs there is evi dence that long term health outcomes can also beachieved. Two studies released in December 2000indicate that California s declines in lung cancerrates and in heart disease deaths can be associatedwith the impact of the comprehensive tobacco control programs. Another major evolution occurred within state tobacco control programs during the 1990s.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,872,Theaccumulation of a half century of work by re searchers policymakers states economists advo cates and many others resulted in the states suingthe tobacco industry to reclaim Medicaid costsincurred by the states for treating patients withtobacco related illnesses. Mississippi was the ﬁrstto ﬁle such a lawsuit and the ﬁrst to settle. Florida Texas and Minnesota also settled individually withthe tobacco industry.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,873,The other forty six statesreached a collective agreement with the tobacco industry known as the Master Settlement Agree ment MSA which would provide an estimated 206 billion over twenty ﬁve years to the states. In1998 Florida and Mississippi committed 100 million and 64 million respectively in settlementfunds to prevent tobacco use. This presents ahistoric opportunity to secure state funding fortobacco control.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,874,Jeffrey P. Koplan director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has characterizedtobacco control as one of the greatest public healthachievements of the twentieth century and as one of the greatest challenges of the twenty ﬁrst. TheHealthy People 2010 goal of achieving a 12 percent prevalence rate has been reached by only onepopulation segment those individuals with six teen years or more of education. The states have demonstrated that tobacco use can be reduced.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,875,The next steps are to assurethat the states have the resources to plan conduct and evaluate comprehensive tobacco control pro grams. A state s ability to carry out such programswill be dependent on the social economic andpolitical context that supports the use or nonuse oftobacco products.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,876,But it also includes such factorsas past experiences with tobacco control programs the level of knowledge and skill of the practition ers the commitment and resolve of state leader ship collaboration with others adequate fundingto support all the components of a program andthe commitment to long term funding.

STATISTICS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH Nearly every day statistics are used to support assertions about health and what people can do toimprove their health.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,886,The press frequently quotesscientiﬁc articles assessing the roles of diet exer cise the environment and access to medical carein maintaining and improving health. Because theeffects are often small and vary greatly from per son to person an understanding of statistics and how it allows researchers to draw conclusionsfrom data is essential for every person interestedin public health.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,887,Statistics is also of paramountimportance in determining which claims regard ing factors affecting our health are not valid notsupported by the data or are based on faultyexperimental design and observation.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,888,When an assertion is made such as electromagnetic ﬁelds are dangerous or smok ing causes lung cancer statistics plays a centralrole in determining the validity of such statements.Methods developed by statisticians are used toplan population surveys and to optimally designexperiments aimed at collecting data that allowsvalid conclusions to be drawn and thus eitherconﬁrm or refute the assertions.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,889,Biostatisticiansalso develop the analytical tools necessary to de rive the most appropriate conclusions based onthe collected data. STATISTICS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH 1149ROLE OF BIOSTATISTICS IN PUBLIC HEALTH In the Institute of Medicine s report The Future of Public Health the mission of public health is de ﬁned as assuring conditions in which people canbe healthy.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,890,To achieve this mission three functionsmust be undertaken 1 assessment to identifyproblems related to the health of populations and determine their extent 2 policy development to prioritize the identiﬁed problems determine pos sible interventions and or preventive measures set regulations in an effort to achieve change andpredict the effect of those changes on the popula tion and 3 assurance to make certain that neces sary services are provided to reach the desiredgoal as determined by policy measures and tomonitor how well the regulators and other sectorsof the society are complying with policy.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,891,An additional theme that cuts across all of the above functions is evaluation that is how well arethe functions described above being performed. Biostatistics plays a key role in each of these functions. In assessment the value of biostatistics lies in deciding what information to gather to identify health problems in ﬁnding patterns incollected data and in summarizing and presentingthese in an effort to best describe the target popu lation.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,892,In so doing it may be necessary to designgeneral surveys of the population and its needs toplan experiments to supplement these surveys and to assist scientists in estimating the extentof health problems and associated risk factors.Biostatisticians are adept at developing the neces sary mathematical tools to measure the problems to ascertain associations of risk factors with dis ease and creating models to predict the effects ofpolicy changes.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,893,They create the mathematical toolsnecessary to prioritize problems and to estimate costs including undesirable side effects of preven tive and curative measures. In assurance and policy development bio statisticians use sampling and estimation methodsto study the factors related to compliance andoutcome. Questions that can be addressed includewhether an improvement is due to compliance orto something else how best to measure compli ance and how to increase the compliance level inthe target population.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,894,In analyzing survey data biostatisticians take into account possible inaccu racies in responses and measurements both inten tional and unintentional. This effort includes howto design survey instruments in a way that checksfor inaccuracies and the development of tech niques that correct for nonresponse or for missingobservations. Finally biostatisticians are directlyinvolved in the evaluation of the effects of inter ventions and whether to attribute beneﬁcial changesto policy.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,895,UNDERSTANDING VARIATION IN DATA Nearly all observations in the health ﬁeld show considerable variation from person to person making it difﬁcult to identify the effects of a givenfactor or intervention on a person s health. Mostpeople have heard of someone who smoked everyday of his or her life and lived to be ninety or ofthe death at age thirty of someone who neversmoked.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,896,The key to sorting out seeming contradic tions such as these is to study properly chosengroups of people samples and to look for theaggregate effect of something on one group ascompared to another. Identifying a relationship for example between lung cancer and smoking does not mean that everyone who smokes will getlung cancer nor that if one refrains from smokingone will not die from lung cancer.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,897,It does mean however that the group of people who smoke aremore likely than those who do not smoke to diefrom lung cancer. How can we make statements about groups of people but be unable to claim with any certaintythat these statements apply to any given individualin the group Statisticians do this through the useof models for the measurements based on ideas ofprobability.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,898,For example it can be said that theprobability that an adult American male will diefrom lung cancer during one year is 9 in 100 000for a nonsmoker but is 190 in 100 000 for asmoker. Dying from lung cancer during a year iscalled an event and probability is the sciencethat describes the occurrence of such events. For alarge group of people quite accurate statementscan be made about the occurrence of events eventhough for speciﬁc individuals the occurrence isuncertain and unpredictable.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,899,A simple but usefulmodel for the occurrence of an event can be made based on two important assumptions 1 for a group of individuals the probability that an event STATISTICS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH 1150occurs is the same for all members of the group and 2 whether or not a given person experiencesthe event does not affect whether others do. Theseassumptions are known as 1 common distribu tion for events and 2 independence of events.This simple model can apply to all sorts of publichealth issues.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,900,Its wide applicability lies in the free dom it affords researchers in deﬁning events andpopulation groups to suit the situation beingstudied. Consider the example of brain injury and helmet use among bicycle riders. Here groups canbe deﬁned by helmet use yes no and the event is severe head injury resulting from a bicycle acci dent. Of course more comprehensive models canbe used but the simple ones described here arethe basis for much public health research.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,901,Table 1presents hypothetical data about bicycle accidentsand helmet use in thirty cases. It can be seen that 20 percent 2 out of 10 of those not wearing a helmet sustained severe headinjury compared to only 5 percent 1 out of 20 among those wearing a helmet for a relative riskof four to one. Is this convincing evidence Anapplication of probability tells us that it is not andthe reason is that with such a small number ofcases this difference in rates is just not that unu sual.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,902,To better understand this concept the mean ing of probability and what conclusions can drawnafter setting up a model for the data must bedescribed. Probability is the branch of mathematics that uses models to describe uncertainty in the occur rence of events. Suppose that the chance of severe head injury following a bicycle accident is one in ten. This risk can be simulated using a spinningdisk with the numbers 1 through 10 equallyspaced around its edge with a pointer in thecenter to be spun.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,903,Since a spinner has no memory spins will be independent. A spin will indicatesevere head injury if a 1 shows up and no severehead injury for 2 through 10. The pointercould be spun ten times to see what could happenamong ten people not wearing a helmet. Thetheory of probability uses the binomial distribu tion to tell you exactly what could happen with tenspins and how likely each outcome is.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,904,For exam ple the probability that we would not see a 1 inten spins is .349 the probability that we will seeTable 1 Wearing helmetNot wearing helmet Severe head injury Not severe head injury1 192 8 SOURCE Courtes y of author. exactly one 1 in ten spins is .387 exactly two is .194 exactly three is .057 exactly four is .011 exactly ﬁve is .001 with negligible probabilityfor six or more.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,905,So if this is a good model forhead injury the probability of two or more peo ple experiencing severe head injury in ten acci dents is .264. A common procedure in statistical analysis is to hypothesize that no difference exists between two groups called the null hypothesis and then to use the theory of probability to determine howtenable such an hypothesis is. In the bicycle acci dent example the null hypothesis states that therisk of injury is the same for both groups.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,906,Probabil ity calculations then tell how likely it is under nullhypothesis to observe a risk ratio of four or morein samples of twenty people wearing helmets andten people not wearing helmets. With a commonrisk of injury equal to one in ten for both groups and with these sample sizes the surprising answeris that one will observe a risk ratio greater thanfour quite often about 16 percent of the time which is far too large to give us conﬁdence inasserting that wearing helmets prevents head injury.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,907,This is the essence of statistical hypothesis testing. One assumes that there is no difference inthe occurrences of events in our comparison groups and then calculates the probabilities of variousoutcomes. If one then observes something that hasa low probability of happening given the assump tion of no differences between groups then onerejects the hypothesis and concludes that there is adifference.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,908,To thoroughly test whether helmet usedoes reduce the risk of head injury it is necessaryto observe a larger sample large enough so thatany observed differences between groups cannotbe simply attributed to chance.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,909,STATISTICS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH 1151SOURCES OF DATA Data used for public health studies come from observational studies as in the helmet use exam ple above from planned experiments and fromcarefully designed surveys of population groups.An example of a planned experiment is the use ofa clinical trial to evaluate a new treatment forcancer.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,910,In these experiments patients are ran domly assigned to one of two groups treatmentor placebo a mock treatment and then fol lowed to ascertain whether the treatment affectsclinical outcome. An example of a survey is theNational Health and Nutrition Examination Sur vey NHANES conducted by the National Centerfor Health Statistics. NHANES consists of inter views of a carefully chosen subset of the popula tion to determine their health status but chosenso that the conclusions apply to the entire U.S.population.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,911,Both planned experiments and surveys of popu lations can give very good data and conclusions partly because the assumptions necessary for theunderlying probability calculations are more likelyto be true than for observational studies. Nonethe less much of our knowledge about public healthissues comes from observational studies and aslong as care is taken in the choice of subjects and inthe analysis of the data the conclusions can be valid.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,912,The biggest problem arising from observa tional studies is inferring a cause and effect rela tionship between the variables studied. The origi nal studies relating lung cancer to smoking showed astriking difference in smoking rates between lungcancer patients and other patients in the hospitalsstudied but they did not prove that smoking wasthe cause of lung cancer.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,913,Indeed some of theoriginal arguments put forth by the tobacco com panies followed this logic stating that a signiﬁcantassociation between factors does not by itself prove acausal relationship. Although statistical inferencecan point out interesting associations that couldhave a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on public health policyand decision making these statistical conclusionsrequire further study to substantiate a cause and effect relationship as has been done convincinglyin the case of smoking.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,914,A tremendous amount of recent data is readily available through the Internet. These include al ready tabulated observations and reports as wellas access to the raw data. Some of this data cannot be accessed through the Internet because of conﬁ dentiality requirements but even in this case it issometimes possible to get permission to analyzethe data at a secure site under the supervision ofemployees of the agency.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,921,Much of public health is concerned with inter national health and the World Health Organiza tion WHO makes available a large volume of dataon international health issues as well as provideslinks to its publications. The Center for Interna tional Earth Science Information Network pro vides data on world population and its goals are tosupport scientists engaged in international research.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,922,The Internet provides an opportunity for health research unequaled in the history of public health.The accessibility quality and quantity of data areincreasing so rapidly that anyone with an under standing of statistical methodology will soon beable to access the data necessary to answer ques tions relating to health. ANALYSIS OF TABULATED DATA One of the most commonly used statistical tech niques in public health is the analysis of tableddata which is generally referred to as contin gency table analysis.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,923,In these tables observedproportions of adverse events are compared in thecolumns of the table by a method known as a chi square test. Such data can naturally arise from any of the three data collection schemes men tioned. In our helmet for example observationaldata from bicycle accidents were used to create atable with helmet use deﬁning the columns andhead injury the rows. In a clinical trial the col umns are deﬁned by the treatment placebo groups and the rows by outcome e.g. disease remissionor not .
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,924,In a population survey columns can bedifferent populations surveyed and rows indica tors of health status e.g. availability of healthinsurance . The chi square test assumes that thereis no difference between groups and calculates astatistic based on what would be expected if noTable 3 Wearing helmetNot wearing helmet Severe head injury Not severe head injury9.934 90.0665.066 45.933Row totals 15 136 Column totals 100 51 151 SOURCE Courtesy of author. difference truly existed and on what is actually observed.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,925,The calculation of the test statistic andthe conclusions proceed as follows 1. The expected frequency E is calculated assuming no difference for each cell inthe table by ﬁrst adding to get the totalsfor each row the totals for each column and the grand total equal to the totalsample size then for each cell weﬁnd the expected count E rowtotal columntotal grandtotal . 2. For each cell in the table let O be the observed count and calculate O E 2 E. 3.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,926,The values from step 2 are summed over all cells in the table. This is the teststatistic X. 4. If X exceeds 3.96 for a table with four cells then the contingency table is said tobe statistically signiﬁcant. If the sampleand the resulting analysis is repeated alarge number of times this signiﬁcantresult will happen only 5 percent of thetime when there truly is no differencebetween groups and hence this is called a 5 percent signiﬁcance test. 5.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,927,For tables with more than two rows and or columns different comparisonsvalues are needed. For a table with sixcells we check to see if X is larger than5.99 with eight cells we compare X to7.81 and for nine or ten cells we compareX to 9.49. 6. This method has problems if there are too many rows and columns and not enoughobservations.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,928,In such cases the tableshould be reconﬁgured to have a smaller STATISTICS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH 1153Table 4 Wearing helmetNot wearing helmet Severe head injury Not severe head injury2.450 0.2704.805 0.530 SOURCE Courtes y of author. number of cells. If any of the E values in a table fall below ﬁve some of the rowsand or columns should be combined tomake all values of E ﬁve or more. Suppose a larger data set is used for our helmet use head injury example see Table 2 .
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,929,It is worthwhile noting that the proportions showing head injury for these data are almost thesame as before but that the sample size is nowconsiderably larger 151. Following the steps out lined above the chi square statistic can be calcu lated and conclusions can be drawn 1. The total for the ﬁrst column is 100 for the second column 51 for the ﬁrst row15 and for the second row 136.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,930,Thegrand total is 151 the total sample size.The expected frequencies that is the Es assuming no difference in injury ratesbetween the helmet group and the nohelmet group are given in Table 3. It isquite possible for the Es to be non integer and if so we keep the decimal part in allour calculations. 2. The values for O E 2 E are presented in Table 4. 3. X 8.0554. Because this exceeds 3.84 we have a signiﬁcant association between the helmetuse and head injury at the 5 percent level.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,931,The chi square procedure presented here is one of the most important analytic techniquesused in public health research. Its simplicity allowsit to be widely used and understood by nearly allprofessionals in the ﬁeld as well as by interestedthird parties. Much of what we know about whatTable 5 Low blood lead levelHigh blood lead level Low soil lead level High soil lead level63 3737 63 SOURCE Courtesy of author. makes us healthy or what endangers our lives has been shown through the use of contingency tables.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,932,STUDYING RELATIONSHIPS AMONG VARIABLES A major contribution to our knowledge of public health comes from understanding trends in dis ease rates and examining relationships amongdifferent predictors of health. Biostatisticians ac complish these analyses through the ﬁtting ofmathematical models to data. The models can varyfrom a simple straight line ﬁt to a scatter plot of X Y observations all the way to models with a varietyof nonlinear multiple predictors whose effectschange over time.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,933,Before beginning the task ofmodel ﬁtting the biostatistician must ﬁrst be thor oughly familiar with the science behind the meas urements be this biology medicine economics or psychology. This is because the process mustbegin with an appropriate choice of a model.Major tools used in this process include graphicsprograms for personal computers which allowthe biostatistician to visually examine complexrelationships among multiple measurements onsubjects.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,934,The simplest graph is a two variable scatter plot using the y axis to represent a response vari able of interest the outcome measurement andthe x axis for the predictor or explanatory vari able. Typically both the x and y measurementstake on a whole range of values commonly re ferred to as continuous measurements or some times as quantitative variables.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,935,Consider for ex ample the serious health problem of high blood lead levels in children known to cause seriousbrain and neurologic damage at levels as low as 10micrograms per deciliter. Since lead was removedfrom gasoline blood levels of lead in children in STATISTICS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH 1154Figure 1 log soil lead 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 .50.511.5 log blood lead SOURCE Courtesy of author. the United States have been steadily declining but there is still a residual risk from environmentalpollution.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,936,One way to assess this problem is torelate soil lead levels to blood levels in a survey ofchildren taking a measurement of the blood leadconcentration on each child and measuring thesoil lead concentration in milligrams per kilo gram from a sample of soil near their residences.As is often the case a plot of the blood levels andsoil concentrations shows some curvature so trans formations of the measurements are taken to makethe relationship more nearly linear.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,937,Choices com monly used for transforming data include takingsquare roots logarithms and sometimes recipro cals of the measurements. For the case of lead logarithms of both the blood levels and of the soilconcentrations produce an approximately linearrelationship. Of course this is not a perfect rela tionship so when plotted the data will appear as acloud of points as shown in Figure 1.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,938,This plot representing two hundred children was produced by a statistical software programcalled Stata using as input values from a numberof different studies on this subject. On the graph the software program plotted the ﬁtted straightline to the data called the regression equation of yon x. The software also prints out the ﬁtted regres sion equation y .29x .01.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,939,How does one inter pret this regression First it is not appropriate tointerpret it for an individuals it applies to thepopulation from which the sample was taken. Itsays that a increase of 1 in log soil lead concentra tion will correspond on average to an increase in STATISTICS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH 1155log blood lead of .29. To predict the average blood lead level given a value for soil lead theentire equation is used.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,940,For example a soil leadlevel of 1 000 milligrams per kilogram whose logis three predicts an average log blood lead level of.29 3 .01 .57 corresponding to a measuredblood level of 7.6 micrograms per deciliter. Themain point is that from the public health view point there is a positive relationship between thelevel of lead in the soil and blood lead levels in thepopulation. An alternative interpretation is to statethat soil lead and blood lead levels are positivelycorrelated.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,941,We note that many calculators and all statisti cal software for personal computers can calculate the best line for a given data set. Commercially available statistical software packages such as Stata SAS and SPSS can be purchased in versions forboth IBM and Macintosh PCs. One comprehen sive package EpiInfo 2000 may be acquired freefrom CDC and can be downloaded on the Internet. As in the case of contingency tables the sig niﬁcance of the regression can be tested.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,942,In thiscase as in all of statistics statistical signiﬁcancedoes not refer to the scientiﬁc importance of therelationship but rather to a test of whether or notthe observed relationship is the result of randomassociation. Every statistical software package forpersonal computers includes a test of signiﬁcanceas part of its standard output.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,943,These packages andsome hand calculators along with the line itself will produce an estimate of the correlation be tween the two variables called the correlationcoefﬁcient or r. If t is larger than 2 or smallerthan 2 the regression is declared signiﬁcant at the5 percent level.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,944,For the data in Figure 1 r is 0.42.This number can very easily be used to test for thestatistical signiﬁcance of the regression throughthe following formula t r 0.42 6.51n 2 1 r2198 .8236 The number r calculated this way must lie between l and 1 and is often interpreted as ameasure of how close to a straight line the data lie.Values near 1 indicate a nearly perfect linearrelationship while values near 0 indicate no linearrelationship.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,945,It is important not to make the mis take of interpreting r near 0 as meaning there is norelationship whatever a curved relation can leadto low values of r.The relationship between soil lead and blood lead could be studied using the contingency tableanalysis discussed earlier. For each child both thesoil lead levels and the blood lead levels could beclassiﬁed as high or low choosing appropriatecriteria for the deﬁnitions of high and low.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,946,Thistoo would have shown a relationship but it wouldnot be as powerful nor would it have quantiﬁedthe relationship between the two measurements asthe regression did. Choosing a cutoff value for lowand high on each measurement that divides eachgroup into two equal size subgroups as shownin Table 5. The chi square statistic calculated from this table is 13.5 which also indicates an associationbetween blood lead level and soil lead levels inchildren.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,947,The conclusion is not as compelling as inthe linear regression analysis and a lot of informa tion in the data has been lost by simplifying themin this way. One beneﬁt however of this simpleranalysis is that we do not have to take logarithms ofthe data and worry about the appropriate choiceof a model. Regression is a very powerful tool and it is used for many different data analyses.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,948,It can beused to compare quantitative measurements ontwo groups by setting x 1 for each subject ingroup one and setting x 2 for each subject ingroup two. The resulting analysis is equivalent tothe two sample t test discussed in every elementarystatistics text. The most common application of regression analysis occurs when an investigator wishes torelate an outcome measurement y to several xvariables multiple linear regression.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,949,For exam ple regression can be used to relate blood lead tosoil lead environmental dust income education and sex. Note that as in this example the xvariables can be either quantitative such as soillead or qualitative such as sex and they can beused together in the same equation. The statisticalsoftware will easily ﬁt the regression equation andprint out signiﬁcance tests for each explanatoryvariable and for the model as a whole.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,950,When wehave more than one x variable there is no simpleway to perform the calculations or to representthem and one must rely on a statistical package todo the work. Regression methods are easily extended to compare a continuous response measurement STATISTICS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH 1156across several groups this is known as analysis of variance also discussed in every elementary statis tics text. It is done by choosing for the x variablesindicators for the different groups so calleddummy variables.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,951,An important special case of multiple linear regression occurs when the outcome measure ment y is dichotomous indicating presence orabsence of an attribute. In fact this technique called logistic regression is one of the most com monly used statistical techniques in public healthresearch today and every statistical software pack age includes one or more programs to perform theanalysis.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,952,The predictor x variables used for logistic regression are almost always a mixture of quantita tive and qualitative variables. When only qualita tive variables are used the result is essentiallyequivalent to a complicated contingency tableanalysis. Methods of regression and correlation are essential tools for biostatisticians and public healthresearchers when studying complex relationshipsamong different quantitative and qualitative meas urements related to health.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,953,Many of the studieswidely quoted in the public health literature haverelied on this powerful technique to reach theirconclusions.

STOCHASTIC MODEL See Probability Model STRATIFICATION OF DATA In public health stratiﬁcation is deﬁned as the process of partitioning data into distinct ornonoverlapping groups. These distinct groups canrepresent among other things treatment regimens geographical regions or study centers. Althoughthis deﬁnition is seemingly straightforward strati ﬁcation is a term that can be used to characterizeeither the design of a study e.g.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,961,stratiﬁed sam pling or alternatively an analytic approach strati ﬁed analysis that can be applied to data that hasalready been collected. In both cases stratiﬁcation is used because the study population consists ofsubpopulations or subdomains that are of particu lar interest to the researcher.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,962,Stratiﬁed sampling is an approach used to ensure that an adequate number of individuals orentities are sampled so that comparisons of aparameter of interest can be made between two ormore groups strata within a population. Forexample a social worker may be interested incomparing the prevalence of drug use betweenthose who live on the streets and the generalpopulation.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,963,This could be evaluated by sampling asufﬁcient number of individuals in each of the twogroups and performing the relevant statistical test to determine whether the prevalence of drug usewas equal in these two groups.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,964,In such a study sampling is best approached using a stratiﬁeddesign because different recruitment strategiesare needed to collect data from these two groups.That is it is unlikely that homeless individualscould be contacted using telephone or voting lists.In some cases data can only be divided into strataafter it has been collected this technique is re ferred to as poststratiﬁcition.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,965,For example a healthprofessional might be interested in determiningdifferences in cigarette smoking between maleand female smokers in order to devise a programto reduce smoking in teenagers. Such informationcould readily be extracted from an existing healthsurvey that collected information on the smokinghabits of both sexes.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,966,As described at the outset stratiﬁcation is an important analytic tool in studies of public health.As an illustration investigators conducting a studyof smoking and lung cancer may elect to stratifystudy participants by gender in order to determinewhether the females are more susceptible to theeffects of smoking than males.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,967,Notable differencesin the risk of lung cancer due to smoking betweenmen and women would indicate that gender modi ﬁes the effect of cigarette smoking on the risk ofdeveloping lung cancer. In this instance the terms effect modiﬁer or interaction variable couldbe applied to describe the role of gender on therelation between smoking and lung cancer.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,968,Stratiﬁed analysis can also be used to assess whether the variable upon which the strata arebased confounds the relationship between theoutcome and the factor of primary interest. Aconfounding variable is a factor that is associatedwith both the factor of primary interest and theoutcome under study. The inability to control for aconfounding variable will bias inferences drawnbetween the factor of the primary interest and theoutcome variable.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,969,With stratiﬁed analysis if theoverall effect using missing data pooled from thedifferent strata is approximately equal to the stra tum speciﬁc estimates of effect this indicates thatthe stratiﬁcation variable does not confound the result. Alternatively if the stratum speciﬁc esti mates of risk are similar to each other yet differentfrom the risk estimate based using the entirety of STREET VIOLENCE 1158the data then this indicates that the stratiﬁcation variable is a confounder.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,970,Stratiﬁcation can also be used within the con text of a randomized control trial. For example insome clinical studies patients may be divided intosubgroups strata based on factors that are thoughtto be related to outcome. Within each strata patients could randomly be assigned to differenttreatment groups e.g.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,971,placebo or treatment .This analytic approach would permit the effective ness of the different treatments to be comparedwithin each stratum while also ensuring the treat ment and control groups are similar with respectto the postulated risk factors upon which thestratiﬁcation was based.

STREET VIOLENCE Violence is the intentional use of physical force against another person or against oneself whicheither results in or has a high likelihood of result ing in injury or death Rosenberg O Carroll andPowell 1992 p. 3071 .
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,973,Violence is typically catego rized according to the relationship between thevictim and the perpetrator as well as the locationin which it takes place. In general street violence refers to the use of physical force by individuals or groups withinpublic spaces the result of which may involveinjury or death.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,974,This deﬁnition is quite broad and includes the forms of violence that are most often addressed by public health practitioners and re searchers particularly gang and youth violence which often take place in the street or otheropen areas.Although statistics for violent crimes do not always specify the location of the incident ap proximately one third of violent crimes occur in astreet or open area.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,975,School related violence hasgained widespread media attention and concern however many violent acts committed by adoles cents take place off of school property. In 1999 over one third 35 of U.S. high school studentshad been in a physical ﬁght while only one inseven students had a physical ﬁght on schoolproperty.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,976,Homicides of school age individuals areeven less likely to take place on school property.Between 1992 and 1994 less than 1 percent ofhomicides of school age persons occurred on schoolproperty with the majority occurring on streets. Street violence takes a variety of different forms including actual or threatened homicide rape and sexual assault robbery with or withoutinjury and assault.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,977,Although not all street vio lence is gang related the relationship of gangs tohomicide makes street violence a public healthissue. Over 94 percent of U.S. cities with popula tions over 100 000 have street gangs and manysmaller and more rural cities report street gangactivity. Membership in a street gang increases therisk of violent death by 60 percent. Recognition of violence including street vio lence as a public health priority is relatively re cent.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,978,In 1979 the Surgeon General s report Healthy People included interpersonal violence as one of ﬁfteen priority areas for improving the health ofthe U.S. population. More objectives for improv ing the public s health through reducing violencehave been included in the updated versions Healthy People 2000 Public Health Service 1991 and Healthy People 2010 Public Health Service 2000 . These objectives target health status e.g. reducehomicide rates risk reduction e.g.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,979,reduce weap ons carrying and physical ﬁghting among adoles cents and services increase the proportion ofschools that offer conﬂict resolution programs . Violence particularly among youth is a public health priority because it causes premature death injury and disability. Homicide is the second lead ing cause of death for people aged 15 to 24 years and is the leading cause of death for African American males aged 15 to 24 years.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,980,Street violence may also result in serious nonfatal injury and temporary or permanent disa bility. Among youth violence is a leading cause of STREET VIOLENCE 1159nonfatal injuries second only to motor vehicle accidents. In 1994 an estimated 1.4 million peoplewere treated in hospital emergency departmentsfor violence related injuries. Nearly one half of allthe injuries treated occurred in public buildings oron the street.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,981,Of all of the injuries treated one third were cuts or stab wounds and 5 percent weregunshot wounds. Severe injuries to children dueto intentional shootings also typically occur instreets or other open areas. Street violence also results in ﬁnancial bur dens. Injuries may result in days missed from workor school causing victims to lose wages and oracademic progress.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,982,Injuries resulting in perma nent disability may further affect the social emo tional and economic consequences for victims.Society too bears the ﬁnancial burden of violence related injuries. Acute care and rehabilitation forinjuries can cost thousands of dollars and not allpatients have adequate money or insurance tocover the costs. Unpaid medical costs are passedon to hospitals and taxpayers. STREET VIOLENCE PREVENTION Public health utilizes three levels of prevention primary secondary and tertiary.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,983,Primary preven tion strategies aim to prevent a problem i.e. violent acts before it occurs. The goal of second ary prevention is to prevent further injury. Terti ary prevention aims to limit the extent of disabilityafter an injury has taken place. Criminal justicestrategies for violence prevention are often in thesecondary category.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,984,By removing individuals whohave already become violent criminal justice at tempts to reduce the likelihood of further injuriesor deaths caused by the already violent person.Public health strategies speciﬁcally primary pre vention strategies make an essential contributionto criminal justice efforts because they may keepindividuals from committing violent acts in theﬁrst place.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,985,The public health approach utilizes health event surveillance and epidemiology to determinewho are the victims and perpetrators of violence related injuries and where and when violence related injuries occur. The answers to these ques tions tell public health researchers and practition ers where to direct prevention efforts.Adolescents currently have the highest and most rapidly increasing rates of lethal and nonlethalviolence.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,986,As youth are at much greater risk ofbeing victims or perpetrators of street violence they are an important audience for violence pre vention programs. Further because males Afri can American and Hispanic youth and residentsin poor urban neighborhoods are more likely toengage in and be victims of street violence preven tion programs are also developed speciﬁcally forthese populations.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,987,In order to develop effective prevention pro grams and policies public health must ﬁrst deter mine what factors cause individuals to commitviolent acts. Public health surveillance and epide miology identify risk characteristics. However notall individuals with these characteristics engage inviolence. Public health researchers use a variety oftheories from different disciplines e.g.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,988,psychol ogy sociology criminology and scientiﬁc researchto determine what factors either increase or de crease the risk that individuals will commit violentacts and what factors are possible to change throughprevention programs. Psychosocial proviolenceattitudes low self control and behavioral drugselling weapons carrying characteristics may alsoincrease youths risk for engaging in violent behav iors such as street violence.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,989,Characteristics of social and physical environ ments are also a factor in street violence. Socialenvironments include exposure to violence or vio lence promoting attitudes through families peers schools neighborhoods and even media e.g. television . Adolescents who have been victims orwitnesses of violence are more likely to engage inviolent behaviors.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,990,In addition children raised byindividuals with poor parenting skills those livingin high crime and dangerous urban neighborhoods and those exposed to or involved in gangs aremore likely to engage in violent behaviors. Youngpeople living in urban areas may be more likely toengage in gang and nongang related violence be cause in areas with poor economic and educa tional opportunities violence may become a wayto gain respect and status.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,991,Some violence prevention programs target chil dren and adolescents identiﬁed as having aggres sive behaviors and attitudes and try to changethese behaviors and attitudes before they develop STREET VIOLENCE 1160into more violent behaviors. These programs at tempt to promote self esteem problem solving and development of nonviolent attitudes and in terpersonal skills in high risk children andadolescents. While prevention strategies targeting individu als are important they may fail to reach someindividuals.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,992,It is not always easy to identify whichindividuals will later engage in violent behaviors.Other public health strategies for reducing vio lence focus on community or even societal levelchanges as well as individuals. These changes af fect everyone not just those successfully identiﬁedas being at high risk. As availability of ﬁrearms hasbeen associated with the risk of violence policiesthat reduce the overall availability of weapons onthe street may help reduce ﬁrearm injuries anddeaths.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,993,Changes in the physical structures e.g. improved lighting limitations in through trafﬁc can also reduce rates of violent street crimes withinneighborhoods. Policies that promote economicand educational opportunities may help youngpeople resist the pressures to join gangs in order toachieve self esteem and respect in dangerous high crime neighborhoods.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,994,Some of the most promising prevention pro grams attempt to change a variety of factors thatis they attempt to intervene not only with indi viduals but also with families schools and neigh borhoods. For instance the Seattle Social Devel opment Project promotes positive development ofchildren and youth by training teachers and par ents in classroom and family management strate gies that promote problem solving effective com munication conﬂict resolution skills self esteem and autonomy.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,995,The program is designed to pro mote children s bonding to schools and parents or other positive adult role models so they willbe better able to resist pressures to engage in avariety of health compromising behaviors includ ing violence. Children who participated in thisprogram throughout elementary and middle schoolwere found to be less likely than those who did notparticipate to have engaged in violent behaviors bythe time they were eighteen years old.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,996,Prevention of street violence requires the col laboration and cooperation of public health pro fessionals with those in other academic disciplines law enforcement and social policy positions. Pre vention programs need to be rigorously evaluatedto determine the most effective strategies to pre vent individuals from engaging in street violence.In addition legal and policy strategies could rein force public health efforts to help alleviate thehuman social and economic costs of street violence.

STREPTOCOCCAL INFECTION Among the large family of streptococci the most dangerous is group A hemolytic streptococcus formerly known as Streptococcus pyogenes the pus producing streptococcus. This is responsible forseveral diseases that in the past have had greatpublic health importance and still do in develop ing countries.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1004,Streptococcus pyogenes was the princi pal cause of puerperal sepsis or childbed fever once a leading cause of death in the immediatepostpartum period when delivery of the baby in troduced virulent pathogenic organisms into thebirth canal and uterus.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1005,Streptococcal tonsillitis is a precursor of rheumatic fever and acute ne phritis when the toxin produced by the invadingpathogens provokes an autoimmune response.Streptococcal infection also causes scarlet fever formerly a common and sometimes deadly infec tion of early childhood.All these diseases have become rare since the discovery and development of chemotherapy andantibiotics to which the streptococcus is sensitive.However streptococcal infection has not becomeextinct.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1006,Erysipelas a skin infection remains com mon streptococcal septicemia occurs occasion ally and the rare but dramatic streptococcalcellulitis known as ﬂesh eating disease capturesheadlines when it attacks disﬁgures and some times kills a previously healthy young adult. Humans are the main reservoir of infection which is trans mitted person to person by direct contact or drop let spread with a brief incubation period of one tothree days.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1007,Outbreaks of all these forms of streptococcal infection occur when social and economic condi tions deteriorate as in post Soviet Russia and itssatellites and in many of the world s combat zoneswhere hygiene and public health facilities are rudi mentary or have deteriorated to the stage of beingineffectual. Treatment of streptococcal infectionrelies on antibiotics and prevention requires goodhygiene cleanliness and education about ways tominimize the risks of transmission of this andother pathogens.

Over the short term such stress re sponse pathways are highly adaptive allowing aperson to manage his or her resources in order tonavigate the crisis in some cases however theseprocesses go awry and result in pathology.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1009,Chronicstress is becoming increasingly problematic in theUnited States as workers work longer and harderhours. Approximately one third of all workers re port that they are in high stress jobs and that notonly is stress implicated in 15 percent of all disabil ity claims the number of stress related absences isincreasing. Such prolonged exposure to stress can STRESS 1162also result in consequences in the form of physical illness.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1010,Alternatively a severe acute stressor mayresult in a stress response syndrome such as anacute stress disorder or a post traumatic stressdisorder. In acute stress the mind and body respond with a ﬁght or ﬂight response that involves activa tion of the sympathetic nervous system and releaseof stress hormones such as cortisol. Psychologically this increases the organism s alertness and re sponse time. Physiologically these changes pro vide the organism with the energy needed to meetthe emergency.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1011,Such intense activation helps theorganism in the short term but prolonged activa tion of this system creates problems in that it mayincrease the risk of certain disease states and once set into motion chronic stress responses maybe difﬁcult to extinguish. This has led some re searchers to investigate potential mediating fac tors such as personality.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1012,For example a correla tion has been established between a personalitycharacterized by hostile competitiveness type A and increased risk of myocardial infarction heartattack . An acute stressor or psychological trauma such as a life threatening circumstance presents aperson with new information that may be difﬁcultto assimilate. In an attempt to adapt the personwill typically alternate between contemplation of the stressor and avoidance of reminders of the event.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1013,Such a cycle allows for dose by dose psycho logical processing of the event. Difﬁculties in adap tation may present as an acute stress disorder thatmanifests itself as an extreme version of this cycle.People with such a disorder may have intrusiveremembrances nightmares or even ﬂashbacks ofthe stress event. These can alternate with emo tional numbing interpersonal alienation and ex treme avoidance of traumatic reminders.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1014,A diag nosis of postraumatic stress disorder PTSD ismade if these symptoms persist longer than onemonth. Studies suggest that approximately 0.5percent of men and 1.3 percent of women meetcriteria for PTSD over their lifetime. A largerpercentage approximately 15 of subjects werefound to have some symptoms but did not meetcriteria for the full disorder. At present psychotherapy is the mainstay of treatment for stress response syndromes.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1015,A varietyof approaches exist but they share a common goal of assisting the patient with conscious contempla tion of the event in such a way that it may beassimilated and anxiety responses extinguished.Care must be taken to create an environment ofsafety and to avoid retraumatization which mayoccur with overly rapid exposure to traumaticmemories.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1016,Patients experience decreased feelingsof guilt and shame as they learn that they re sponded to the trauma as adequately as possible.Contemplation of the event in therapy may lead tofurther beneﬁts including an enhanced under standing of the meaning of the event in the largercontext of the individual s life. Psychopharmacologic treatment may be a use ful adjunct for speciﬁc symptom clusters such asassociated anxiety depression and insomnia.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1017,Theprognosis for treatment is good and is improved ifthe patient was without preexisting psychiatriccomorbidity and if the treatment occurs in closeproximity to the event. Brief treatment is fre quently helpful in restoring a patient to a baselinelevel of functioning but longer term treatmentmay be necessary if exposure to the stressor waschronic or occurred in childhood. Stress response systems have developed in humans as an adaptive mechanism to assist indi viduals in times of crisis.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1018,These systems however may also result in physical or psychological pathol ogy. Chronic overactivation of the stress responsemay predispose an individual to greater risk forphysical illnesses such as heart disease. Overlyintense exposure to an acute stressor may result ina stress response syndrome with potentially disa bling consequences. Treatment is however avail able and may return individuals to their previouslevel of functioning.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1024,Resulting speciﬁcneurological symptoms and signs are determinedby the area of the brain that is affected and sincethe complex functions of the brain are eitherlocalized in specialized areas or diffusely distrib uted stroke symptoms may similarly be localizedor generalized in nature. For example the longpathway of motor ﬁbers can be interrupted withresulting hemiparesis involving various cerebralarteries or their branches such as the anterior middle or vertebrobasilar arteries.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1032,This group in aggregate may account forup to a quarter or more of all ischemic strokes. ForAF the treatment of choice to prevent embolicstrokes is long term anticoagulation. Patients whoare not anticoagulation candidates should betreated with antiplatelet drugs. Conditions such asPFO can be treated medically with anticoagula tion surgical and percutaneous options are alsoavailable for PFO closure. Lacunar Strokes.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1033,These strokes refer to small branch occlusions noted previously and includediscrete syndromes such as pure sensory and mo tor hemiparesis. Lacunar strokes result primarilyfrom chronic sustained hypertension and thepathological change is lipohyalinosis of arteri oles. This syndrome may account for 10 to 15percent of all strokes. Adequate control of hyper tension should prevent this condition.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1034,Two ﬁnal categories of diseases causing ischemic strokes are more frequently consideredin younger persons especially those under ﬁfty ﬁveyears of age and involve arteries and blood ele ments. For the former vessel diseases other thanatherosclerosis include inﬂammatory processes such as the arteritides migraine dissection ei ther spontaneous or traumatic moyamoya syn drome ﬁbromuscular disorders MELAS syndrome mitochondrial encephalopathy lactic acidosis andstroke like symptoms and a few others.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1035,For thelatter blood element disorders include clotting and platelets and erythrocyte abnormalities. Themost common clotting disorders are resistanceto protein C activation most frequently due toFactor V Leiden mutation 506Q antiphospholipidsyndrome which includes the lupus anticoagulantand anticardiolipin antibodies reduced antithrom bin III protein C S deﬁciencies plus a fewothers.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1036,Treatment of vascular disorders is tailoredto the individual condition for example migraineis treated with prophylactic agents which pre vent vasospasm arteritides with steroids andimmunosuppressive agents and moyamoya syn drome with a variety of bypass surgical proce dures. Many of the hypercoagulable or prothrom botic conditions are treated with long termanticoagulation. INTRACEREBRAL AND SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGES Rupture of vessels include two large categories.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1037,The more common is intracerebral hemorrhage ICH which results from chronic sustained hy pertension and accounts for approximately 10percent of all strokes. An infrequent cause of ICHis amyloid angiopathy its cause and cure is un known. A second category of vessel rupture issubarachnoid hemorrhage SAH most frequentlydue to aneurysmal rupture but occasionally fromarteriovenous malformations. SAH accounts forabout 5 percent of all strokes.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1038,Gene and molecularpathological markers to identify persons at risk will hopefully provide interventional tools to bothprevent and treat subjects at risk before aneurysmal rupture. ICH occurs in ﬁve brain sites most com monly in the putamen. With substantial cerebellarICH in a noncomatose patient surgical evacuationcan be life saving. The only other site that maybeneﬁt from surgery is polar or white matterICH.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1039,In neurologically viable patients SAH can betreated successfully with surgical extirpation of theaneurysm or with a variety of endovascular proce dures such as aneurysmal obliteration. PUBLIC HEALTH IMPORTANCE OF STROKES As the third leading cause of death and disability there are important public health implicationsfor strokes especially since many of the strokesyndromes are preventable. This is particularlytrue for those due to atherosclerosis which is themost common cause of strokes.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1040,Except for increas ing age all of the risk factors for atherosclerosis STRUCTURE ACTIVITY RELATIONSHIPS 1165can be either controlled or eliminated. To accom plish this goal better strategies to educate andmotivate the general public are vital.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1041,In addition to controlling risk factors a better understanding of the nature of stroke symptomsby the public is required for expeditious correctiveand therapeutic measures much as has happenedwith the public s general awareness of chest pain asa symptom of a potential heart attack.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1042,Investiga tions on proteomic and gene expression proﬁlesfor strokes to identify individuals at increased riskfor strokes will hopefully provide public healthplanners with an even more powerful tool to inter vene effectively for stroke prevention the ultimatebest treatment of strokes.

STRUCTURE ACTIVITY RELATIONSHIPS A structure activity relationship SAR is used to determine the primary secondary and tertiarystructure of chemicals as a means of ascertainingthe relationship between the effects of differentcompounds on biological systems.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1044,The history ofSARs is over 150 years old and goes back to thelaboratory of Louis Lewin who in the nineteenthcentury developed the early chlorinated methanederivatives chloroform carbon tetrachloride and dichloromethane. The many derivatives of ben zene toluene xylene and others also fall into thiscategory. Once the organic chemists and medici nal chemists began to understand the impact ofchemical structure on biological systems the rudi mentary basis of SARs commenced.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1045,By the 1920s the chemistry of disinfectants pesticides and somedrugs was based on SAR.A classic example of an early SAR was the discovery of the beneﬁts of acetylsalicylic acid aspirin and its near congeners acetaminophenand salicylate. Another early classic example of aSAR was the development of DDT and its analogsand congeners. Several organochlorine pesticidesare members of this broad family. The organo phosphate insecticides are derivatives of the nervegases.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1046,They were structurally engineered to be lesstoxic than nerve gases but to work by the samebasic mechanism. Modern SAR analysis is used to develop al most all drugs. Once the prototype drug is discov ered and its three dimensional characteristics de termined the chemists and structural biologistscan then use the SAR to better understand theinteraction between the drug and the affectedprotein or membrane. The role of the SAR in public health has evolved in a manner similar to drugs.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1047,Based onseminal work carried out by many investigativeteams the key structural determinants of a largeclass of toxicants have been identiﬁed. For exam ple many of the determinants of carcinogenicactivity have been characterized and published.Investigators can then use the SAR to examine anovel chemical structure to see if it contains one ormore of the determinants of carcinogenicity. Theability to use SARs allows for a tier approach tocarcinogenicity testing.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1048,The mutagenic potentialof several classes of chemicals has also been cata loged to the extent that SARs can be used toexamine novel molecules. There is a developingdatabase to use SARs for the determination of skinand eye irritants. In each of these cases the effec tive use of SARs saves time resources and ani mals. As new and better methods of determiningthe three dimensional structure of genes and pro teins become available the importance of SARsfor toxicology will be critical.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1049,Coupling SARs withgene and protein structure should allow the inves tigator to determine the exact site of action of atoxicant. Understanding the function of any givengene functional genomics or protein functionalproteomics can then be used to determine toxicityand risk.

Most cases occur betweenthree weeks and six months of age. The cause ofSIDS is by deﬁnition unknown.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1053,One currenttheory is that ineffective respiration may cause theinfant to stop breathing. Placing infants on theirback when they sleep reduces the incidence ofSIDS by approximately 30 to 40 percent. A num ber of factors increase the incidence of SIDS.These include 1 the use of waterbeds and softbedding 2 sleeping on the stomach 3 infantsborn of mothers who smoke or use drugs 4 young unmarried mothers of low socioeconomicstatus 5 male infants and 6 prematurity andlow birth weight.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1054,There is no genetic cause ofSIDS and immunizations do not cause SIDS.

SUICIDE Suicide is deﬁned as the act of deliberately taking one s own life. It occurs most often in response toa crisis such as a death or the loss of a relationshipor job. During a crisis people experience a widerange of feelings and each person s response tocrisis is different. It is normal to feel frightened oranxious or depressed. If a person feels overwhelmedor unable to cope he or she may try to commitsuicide.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1056,Almost all people who kill themselves either suffered from depression or had substance abuseproblems. People who are lonely and isolated or who have histories of previous suicide attempts are also at greater risk for attempting suicide. In 1996 approximately 31 000 people died of suicide in the United States. Suicide is the eighthleading cause of death overall and the third lead ing cause of death among American teenagers.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1057,InCanada suicide is second only to motor vehicleaccidents as a cause of death among adolescents. The suicide rate is twice the murder rate among those aged 15 to 24 and it has increased dramati cally in recent years. Each year two thousandadolescents commit suicide in the United States.The highest suicide rates in the United States arefound in white men over age 85. Men are morethan four times as likely as women to die bysuicide yet women are more likely to make anonlethal suicide attempt.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1058,Suicide is a major public health problem. The need for a public health approach to suicide can be SUICIDE 1167found in the African American community where the suicide rate among youths more than doubledbetween 1980 and 1995. Further the numberof suicides in the United States outnumberedhomicides in 1995. Each year ﬁrearms are used asmany times for suicide as they are for murder. Insome other countries 71 percent of all ﬁrearmdeaths are suicide.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1059,Attempted and completed suicides result in enormous social economic and medical costs.Suicide is very disruptive to the quality of life ofsurvivors and their families and friends. In 1995 itwas estimated that in the United States each sui cide attempt costs approximately 33 000. Thecost of a completed suicide has been estimated atalmost 400 000. These estimates were derivedfrom factors including the expense of hospitaliza tion medication and more general social costs.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1060,Public health professionals have a major role to play in addressing the problem of suicide. Pub lic health programs and policies can play a partbefore during and after completed or attemptedsuicides. First public health programs are an im portant aspect of the prevention of suicide. Educa tion campaigns can be used to increase knowledgeand to change people s attitudes beliefs and val ues about suicide and about people who may haveattempted suicide. People may have distorted ideasabout suicidal persons.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1061,For example it is a myththat people who commit suicide never talk about itﬁrst. Most people provide important warning signsthat can help to reduce the risk of suicide. Health education can be combined with coun seling or support programs. These programs canbe provided by trained public health professionalsor by peer counselors. For example teenagers canbe trained to provide counseling and support forother teens.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1062,Suicide awareness or prevention pro grams can be delivered in a variety of settings such as schools churches or in the community as awhole. They can also be delivered in psychiatricsettings. A second aspect of the prevention of suicide lies in judging or assessing a person s risk forsuicide. Public health professionals such as nursesor doctors can help to prevent completed suicidesby identifying people who may be thinking aboutor planning to try to commit suicide.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1063,They can alsoprovide support through crisis or suicide preventioncounseling.Public health can also play a valuable role during a suicide attempt. A suicide attempt isoften a person s response to a crisis or to a timewhen they feel overwhelmed or hopeless. Publichealth professionals can help during a suicideattempt through suicide prevention counseling.This type of short term counseling involves pro viding support and guidance to an individual whois suicidal.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1064,Its purpose is to decrease the person semotional pain to make sure that the person issafe and to help develop a plan for coping. Some times suicide prevention counseling includes con necting a person to community or health ser vices. These services can then provide longer termsupport. Suicide prevention counseling is a valuable tool for public health. It is relatively low cost ﬂexible and simple to provide.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1065,A wide variety ofhealth professionals including doctors nurses psychologists and social workers can be taught tohelp people with suicide prevention counselingtechniques. These services can be provided in awide variety of places or settings including hospi tals community clinics and telephone based crisiscenters or helplines. Suicide prevention servicesprovide an important link between the communityand the formal health care system.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1066,Public health professionals who work in sui cide prevention and counseling are faced with agrowing variety of issues and clients. Most commu nities are home to an increased number of peoplefrom a wide variety of cultural and ethnic back grounds. There are also more older people insociety. New issues that might trigger a suicideattempt include elder abuse racism or discrimina tion bullying or gay bashing.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1067,Police ofﬁcers ﬁre men paramedics and others are being trained todeliver on the spot suicide prevention counseling. There is also a role for public health following a completed or attempted suicide. A suicide at tempt or death can have a traumatic effect on thequality of life of survivors and their families andfriends. Public health programs can provide im portant support services to survivors of a suicideattempt and their families.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1068,Public health is only one important part of society s response to suicide as a health and socialproblem. There is also a role for law enforcement the education system the government and the SULFUR CONTAINING AIR POLLUTANTS PARTICULATES 1168formal health care system in prevention treat ment and follow up to a suicide attempt. Law enforcement police ofﬁcers and public health professionals can cooperate to help suicidalpersons. Police ofﬁcers are often the ﬁrst ones onthe scene of a suicide attempt.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1069,They may act toprevent a suicidal person from hurting themselves or someone else through suicide prevention coun seling. The may detain someone who is at high riskfor suicide and refer him or her to appropriatepublic health resources. Legislators can also help to address the chal lenges of suicide by creating policies or laws tosupport the development of public health pro grams and the training of public health profession als.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1070,They can also work to change society s attitudetoward suicide and suicidal people. One exampleof this type of work is the fact that in manycountries suicide is no longer illegal. Attemptingsuicide is seen as a mental health issue not a crime.In 1999 the United States Public Health Serviceissued the ﬁrst ever Surgeon General s Report onMental Health as well as a Call to Action onSuicide Prevention charting out this new approachto suicide.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1071,The educational and health care systems also have a role to play in the prevention treatment and follow up to a suicide attempt. Schools pro vide access to most young people and provide aplace for delivering suicide prevention or aware ness programs. They can also teach young peopleto recognize the warning signs of a potential sui cide attempt in their friends to provide peercounseling and how to get immediate help andsupport.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1072,This is important because young peopleare at higher risk of attempting suicide thanmost adults. The formal health care system hospitals clin ics doctor s ofﬁces can play an important role intwo main ways. First people who are suicidal maycome to an emergency room or a physician sofﬁce. In these cases the health system serves as a ﬁrst response and crisis service.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1073,Second once aperson has been identiﬁed by a public health orlaw enforcement professional as suicidal they mayneed to be hospitalized for a period of time.Health professionals can provide medications andfurther counseling or support to a suicidal personand their family.Once a suicidal person is released from a hospital public health professionals may makehome visits or provide follow up support througha community based clinic.

SULFUR CONTAINING AIR POLLUTANTS PARTICULATES Sulfur oxides are an important class of air pollu tants. They include sulfur dioxide sulfuric acid and various forms of sulfate.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1077,The major determi nant of total sulfur oxide production is the sulfurcontent of fossil fuels which tends to be highest incoal and lowest in natural gas. Sulfur dioxide agas was found to be associated with mortality andmorbidity in London during periods of heavy SUNSCREENS 1169smog and during other air pollution episodes.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1078,While in retrospect the problem had been presentfor decades and perhaps centuries it was notdemonstrated epidemiologically until the 1950s.This led in the 1960s to effective control measures including a switch to fuels with lower sulfur con tent and the banning of many local point sources such as coal used for heating homes. However toxicological studies including controlled humanexposures could not substantiate the epidemio logical association of low levels of sulfur dioxidewith adverse health effects.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1079,It soon became appar ent that the causal relation was primarily withsulfuric acid and sulfates and that atmospheric sulfur dioxide was both a precursor of these par ticulate forms of sulfur oxides and a surrogatemeasure for their air concentrations. Sulfur dioxide can be oxidized in the atmos phere to particulate sulfates the oxidation beingabetted by oxidant smog conditions which alsolead to ozone formation and to particulate formsof nitric oxides.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1080,This oxidation can occur manykilometers downwind from the emission source which accounts for the occurrence of acid rain inrelatively pristine rural areas. The toxicity of par ticulate sulfates depends upon the physical andchemical attributes of the inhaled particles. Size isparticularly important with only smaller particlesbeing inhaled deeply into the lung a recognitionthat has led to a change in the U.S. particulatestandard which originally was based solely on thetotal weight of all airborne particles.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1081,This waschanged to a standard that only measured parti cles with a median diameter of less than 10 mi crons a new proposed standard will only measureparticles with a median diameter less than 2.5microns. Also important to toxicity is the chemical form of the sulfur oxide that is particles that are moreacidic or more soluble in the lung tend to be moretoxic.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1082,Recent epidemiological studies have shownan association of morbidity and mortality withatmospheric levels of particles much lower thanpreviously reported.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1083,The adverse health effectsinclude increases in mortality of the elderly andthose with preexisting heart and lung conditions as well as increases in the incidence of respiratorydisease including asthma attacks in children.These new ﬁndings are the basis for the morestringent particulate standard recently proposedby the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency which will require additional costly control meas ures.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1084,This controversial proposed standard is com plicated by the lack of sufﬁcient clarity in theepidemiological and toxicological data. It has beendifﬁcult to separate out which chemical type orsource of particles is most important a situationthat greatly complicates devising control strate gies. Evidence suggests that adverse health effectsare due to a gas aerosol complex consisting ofmany air pollutant components among whichsulfur oxides play a signiﬁcant role.

SUN EXPOSURE See Sunscreens and Ultraviolet Radiation SUNSCREENS Sunscreens can be categorized as chemical sunscreens physical blockers or a combinationof both. Chemical sunscreens contain UV absorbingmolecules that ﬁlter and limit the amount of ul traviolet UV radiation exposure at the skin.

The older opaque formulations hadlimited cosmetic appeal newer blockers however have been combined with chemical sunscreensto give a more elegant appearance.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1089,In 1978 theFood and Drug Administration classiﬁed sunscreensas drugs and thus established standards for toxicityand quality control. The efﬁcacy of sunscreensis measured in terms of the Sun Protection Fac tor SPF . The SPF is deﬁned as the ratio of the doses of artiﬁcial sunlight required to causeminimal skin redness with and without sunscreen.Individuals who burn easily who are onphotosensitizing medications or who have light sensitive diseases should diligently use sunscreenswith SPFs between 15 and 30.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1090,Reapplication afterprolonged sweating or swimming is recommended.Although sunscreens can provide protection againstsunburns its role in skin cancer protection re mains a controversial issue.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1106,Mostcountries publish national data on a weekly ormonthly basis for communicable diseases andannually for causes of death. The World HealthOrganization WHO publishes causes of deathand data on a few diseases on a global basis usinginternationally accepted case deﬁnitions. In theseways health surveillance provides health depart ments and related agencies with ongoing measure ments of health of populations.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1107,Surveillance datahave the same value to health departments andother interested groups such as drug companies as ﬁnancial data do to commercial enterprises. In the twentieth century there were signiﬁ cant gains in global health as a result of immuniza tion made possible because routine surveillanceof infectious diseases identiﬁed the importantcauses of childhood infections. Furthermore con tinued surveillance after the introduction of vac cines has monitored the effectiveness of immuni zation programs.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1108,Perhaps the most impressiveexample of this was the WHO program for the SURVEY RESEARCH METHODS 1172elimination of smallpox. This program used inten sive worldwide surveillance to identify all suspectedcases of smallpox. Specialized teams then con ﬁrmed the diagnosis and instituted immunizationprograms in the population surrounding eachcase. Surveillance data were also used by manycountries to justify elimination of routine small pox vaccination programs as the number of newcases diminished.

SURVEY RESEARCH METHODS A survey is a method of collecting information about a human population. In a survey direct orindirect contact is made with the units of thestudy e.g. individuals organizations communi ties by using systematic methods of measurementsuch as questionnaires and interviews. Many surveys are conducted around the world each year.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1111,While the purpose topics and size ofthese surveys varies similar steps are followed inthe planning development and implementationof each. These steps are described below with anexample from an existing survey the Youth RiskBehavior Survey which is taken every two years bythe Centers for Disease Control and Preven tion CDC . Identify the Purpose. To determine the pur pose of a survey two questions must be asked 1 what information is wanted or needed and 2 where can this information be found.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1112,A researchermay want to describe a population or program plan a new program or evaluate an existing one. Survey questions might address scientiﬁc issues e.g. What is the prevalence of cigarette smokingin the United States social marketing issues e.g. How do adolescents respond to a new pub lic service announcement or broad public opin ion e.g. Should schools teach sex education . Information may be obtained from a speciﬁc group e.g.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1113,high school students in a city or womenof childbearing age in a state or a broader group e.g. adults in the United States . The populationof interest unit of study can be identiﬁed in acountry state city or local area. For example thepurpose of the Youth Risk Behavior Survey YRBS is to provide information on priority health riskbehaviors among students in grades nine throughtwelve throughout the United States. Develop the Questionnaire.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1114,Once the pur pose of the survey and population of interest aredetermined a questionnaire must be developed.The questionnaire should be designed to providethe information being sought. It is important todetermine which topics are essential and previousquestionnaires can be reviewed to identify ques tions that can be used for each topic. Reviewingprevious questionnaires will also help determinethe best format e.g. multiple choice open ended and question order.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1115,Questionnaires should startwith easy questions rather than sensitive or hard toremember questions. If it is necessary to translatethe questionnaire into multiple languages thequality of the translation can be checked by havingit back translated into the original language. Pilot testing the questionnaire using focus groups or small samples of respondents in thepopulation of interest will determine the accepta bility of the questionnaire to typical respondentsand how long it takes them to complete it.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1116,Acognitive lab test of the questionnaire is also usefulfor determining problems with question compre hension ﬂow and understanding of response op tions. Internal review board or other approvalsshould be obtained prior to survey administration.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1117,The questionnaire for the YRBS contains eighty six multiple choice questions measuring sixcategories of behaviors tobacco use dietary be haviors physical activity alcohol and other druguse sexual behaviors and behaviors that mayresult in unintentional injuries or violence. SURVEY RESEARCH METHODS 1173Identify the Setting. Surveys are usually con ducted in households schools health care facili ties or worksites.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1118,It is important to pick the loca tion where the population of interest can beaccessed most easily and where it can be most fullyrepresented. Because of the need to obtain infor mation from students in grades nine through twelve the YRBS is conducted in schools. Identify the Mode. Within each setting data can be obtained in three ways through personalinterviews through self administrated question naires or by reviewing records.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1119,Personal inter views are conducted by an interviewer who rec ords the respondent s answers on a questionnaireor directly into a computer. Personal interviewsare done in person or by telephone. Self administered questionnaires can be pa per and pencil or electronic in nature. Paper and pencil questionnaires are brought to the respon dent by a data collector or mailed to the respon dent. Electronic questionnaires use computer assisted self interviewing technology.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1120,The ques tions are answered either on a lap top computerthat is brought to the respondent or on a web sitewhich the respondent can access. Record review istypically done on site but also can be done elec tronically if the records are stored on a web site orlocal area network.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1121,Selecting the appropriate combination of set ting and mode is important and should be basedon the survey topic and population of interest aswell as answers to the following questions Which approach will produce the most valid and reliable data For youth sensi tive topics are often best measured in aschool setting using a paper and pencilself administered questionnaire. Which approach will yield the highest response rate Household surveys oftenproduce the highest response rate forgeneral population surveys.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1122,How much will the survey cost to conduct Household surveys are generally the mostexpensive. How long will the survey take to complete Telephone surveys such as public opin ion polls often are the fastest.The YRBS uses a paper and pencil self administered questionnaire which is provided tostudents by a data collector. Select the Sample. The quality of the sample often determines the quality of the data.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1123,Samplesof convenience or volunteer samples produce datarepresentative only of persons who participate inthe survey. Scientiﬁcally selected samples can berepresentative of a larger population and are usedto generalize ﬁndings to persons beyond thosewho participate in the survey. To identify the appropriate sample for a sur vey the survey topic population of interest set ting and mode must all be considered.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1124,Once this is done the next step is to select an appropriatesampling frame from which to draw the sample.The sampling frame is a list of all the members ofthe population of interest. It should be as currentand inclusive as possible. Existing databases maybe available or it may be necessary to construct asampling frame. For the sample design manypossibilities exist e.g. simple random sample stratiﬁed sample cluster sample .
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1125,The YRBS usesa sampling frame of all public and private highschools in the United States and a three stagecluster sample design to produce a nationally rep resentative sample of students in grades ninethrough twelve. Conduct the Fieldwork. Fieldwork begins with obtaining clearance or approval to conduct thesurvey. It may be necessary to seek clearance orapproval not only from respondents e.g. stu dents but also gatekeepers to the respondent e.g. school administrators and parents .
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1126,Datacollection protocols must also be developed. Thegoal is to standardize data collection as much aspossible to assure quality control throughout theﬁeldwork to obtain a high response rate and often to protect the privacy of respondents. Selection of data collectors or ﬁeld staff is also important. It is best to select persons appropriatefor the content of the survey and the demographiccharacteristics of the population of interest e.g.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1127,female interviewers for surveys on reproductivehealth issues among women . Formal training ofdata collectors or ﬁeld staff will help them becomefamiliar with the questionnaire format content mode of data collection data collection protocol and quality control procedures. SURVEYS 1174Before the YRBS is conducted clearance is obtained from school administrators and parents.Then trained data collectors are sent to eachschool to collect data according to the surveyprotocol.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1128,Because of the sensitive nature of thequestionnaire special procedures are used to pro tect student privacy. Enter Edit and Prepare Data for Analysis. Since the 1980s data entry has become easier dueto advances in electronic data input.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1129,Previously most survey data were entered manually by keypunching and then reentered to assure accuracy.Today most survey data collected using question naires are scanned electronically into a data set.Data collected via computer assisted interviewing are automatically entered into a data set. Once entered the data are edited for out of range re sponses simple consistency and logic errors. Thenthe sample is weighted to adjust for nonresponse varying probabilities of selection and sample char acteristics.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1130,Weighting is necessary to ensure thatthe data are representative of the entire popula tion of interest. YRBS questionnaire booklets are scanned to produce the data ﬁle. Basic out of range and con sistency edits are run and a weighting factor isapplied to each student record to adjust fornonresponse and for varying probabilities ofselection. Conduct Analyses. Analyses are done using a software package that incorporates the sampledesign.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1131,Several software packages have been devel oped to analyze complex survey data e.g. STATA SUDAAN and Westvar . Without these packages accurate standard errors cannot be produced.Analyses are used to answer the questions thatwere originally developed to identify the purposeand population of interest for the survey. They should be kept as simple as possible to enhance the usefulness of the data for multiple audiences.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1132,Toanalyze YRBS data SAS and SUDAAN are used tocompute prevalence estimates and 95 percent con ﬁdence intervals for priority health risk behaviorsamong high school students. Write and Disseminate Reports. Survey data are often used to improve policies and programs.Consequently key decision makers need to beable to access and understand the data. In additionto formal research papers other methods can beused to share survey results such as press releases fact sheets or pamphlets or Internet materials.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1133,If the needs and interests of the target audience areconsidered it will enhance the likelihood they willact on the results. YRBS data are disseminated inMMWR Surveillance Summaries fact sheets aCD Rom YOUTH 99 on the CDC web site athttp www.cdc.gov nccdphp dash yrbs and in numerous professional journals.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1135,SURVEYS The word survey comes from the Latin sur over and videre to see and it eventually came to mean a general or comprehensive view of anything.Studies that involve the systematic collection ofdata about populations are usually called surveys.This is especially true when they are concernedwith large or widely dispersed groups of people.When they deal with only a fraction of a totalpopulation a fraction representative of the total they are called sample surveys.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1136,The term samplesurvey should ideally be used only if the part ofthe population studied is selected by acceptedstatistical methods. Surveys can be classiﬁed broadly into two types descriptive and analytical. In a descriptivesurvey the objective is simply to obtain certaininformation about large groups.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1137,In an analyticalsurvey comparisons are made between differentsubgroups of the population in order to discoverwhether differences exist among them that mayenable researchers to form or verify hypothesesabout the forces at work in the population.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1141,SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT The term sustainable development was popular ized in 1987 by the World Commission on Envi ronment and Development. It refers to a system atic approach to achieving human development ina way that sustains planetary resources based onthe recognition that human consumption is occur ring at a rate that is beyond Earth s capacity tosupport it.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1142,Population growth and the develop mental pressures spawned by an unequal distribu tion of wealth are two major driving forces that arealtering the planet in ways that threaten the long term health of humans and other species onthe planet. Human health is dependent on the healthy functioning of the earth s ecosystem. These sys tems would be overwhelmed if all of the earth sinhabitants were to match the consumption pat terns of wealthier nations.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1143,Sustainable develop ment requires alterations in the lifestyle of thewealthy to live within the carrying capacity of theenvironment. To achieve sustainability there is aneed for holistic responses to global issues such asurbanization and energy overconsumption andthere is a need for better measures of ecologicaland social sustainability.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1144,While sustainable devel opment is a prerequisite for the long term healthof humans it will not be possible to achievesustainability in much of the world unless the tollof major health scourges such as malaria and HIV human immunodeﬁciency virus infection is sig niﬁcantly reduced.

SUSTAINABLE HEALTH The concept of health as a sustainable state be came part of the health lexicon in the last two SUSTAINABLE HEALTH 1176decades of the twentieth century.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1147,It is related to the idea of environmental sustainability and makesexplicit the notion that humans and other livingcreatures on earth are interdependent. If humanaffairs are conducted in such a way as to sustainlife supporting ecosystems in a stable state of equi librium then humans will survive and ﬂourish. If however a local regional or global ecosystem isdegraded beyond the point where it is sustainable then the health and survival of humans in thatecosystem cannot be sustained.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1148,As Maurice King aresearch fellow at the University of Leeds ex plained the population is then caught in a demo graphic trap. Without external food aid or out migration people in such an ecosystem will starve. Sometimes a nation tribe or ethnic group that isdemographically trapped will attempt to ﬁght itsway out. The evidence supporting a direct causalrelationship between environmental stress and vio lent armed conﬂict has been documented by Tho mas Homer Dixon.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1149,The ultimate cause of suchconﬂict is an imbalance between the number ofpeople and the resources that are available tosustain them. Sometimes it is difﬁcult to say which comes ﬁrst environmental i.e. ecosystem pressure orpopulation pressure. A previously stable and sus tainable ecosystem may be irretrievably changedby natural forces such as a volcanic eruption buthuman activity and population pressure are themost common causes.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1150,Human activities may beunwise agricultural practices like over grazing asavannah with sparse rainfall excessive irrigationthat alters the soil chemistry or destruction offood producing land for strip mining or hydroe lectric dam development or warfare that destroyswhat had previously been a stable agriculturalecosystem or depletes arable land of the workforceneeded to maintain it.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1151,The end result is a viciouscycle unsustainable pressure on life supportingecosystems and a progressively deteriorating stateof population health. Sustainable health is often linked to sustain able population growth or a steady state popula tion . In the second half of the twentieth century some countries in Africa and South Asia experi enced a rate of population growth that exceededthe capacity of regional and local ecosystems tosustain them.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1152,In the Sahel an arid zone in north western Africa a sequence of droughts and occa sional ﬂash ﬂoods led to overgrazing on a fragilesavannah that was unsuitable for any form of agricultural development to begin with. As a re sult the region became a desert and the peoplebegan to starve. Their predicament was eased byextensive out migration but even so in the inter mittent crises of severe food shortages and re gional famines in which many died they were dependent upon food aid from other parts ofthe world.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1153,Human communities require several kinds of resources to survive in a healthy state. The abso lute essentials are secure and safe water food andshelter. Other factors that help create sustainablehealth include peace freedom from oppression protection from infection secure work and eco nomic stability.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1154,To achieve these states people especially girls and women require the ability tocontrol their own destiny including their repro ductive capacity and the ability to care adequatelyfor themselves and for their dependent infantsand others unable to take care of themselves. Thisability in turn requires insight and understandingthat are acquired through education. Literacy therefore is another essential prerequisite for sus tainable health.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1155,Early in the twenty ﬁrst century allthese prerequisites are lacking in some parts of theworld especially in several countries in sub SaharanAfrica where health is emphatically not sustain able.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1156,In these countries the environment is se verely stressed and is being further degraded by ill judged agricultural practices and destructive ex traction of mineral resources such as diamonds aswell as a lack of concern for indigenous fauna andﬂora leading to catastrophic loss of biodiversity.Increasing numbers of children and young adultsare illiterate many having spent their entire livesengaged in armed conﬂict.

Manifestly health is not sustainable inmuch of the African continent south of the Sahara and the situation is getting worse.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1158,In this setting several kinds of action are urgently required to achieve sustainable health.Violent armed conﬂicts must be ended which SYDENHAM THOMAS 1177requires peace enforcement a stage beyond peacekeeping which has in the past been the mainfocus of United Nations peacekeeping forces. Popu lations must be educated so they gain an under standing of their situation and what must be doneto improve it.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1159,Massive public health endeavors arerequired to control the HIV AIDS pandemic tocontrol malaria and other tropical infectious dis eases and with almost equal urgency to control infectious and nutritional deﬁciency diseases es pecially among children.

SYDENHAM THOMAS Thomas Sydenham 1624 1689 is often referred to as the English Hippocrates because of the em phasis in his medical practice and teachings ofthe importance of bedside observation.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1165,His writ ings controversial in his day condemned theoriz ing in medicine and taught that the understandingof disease and its treatment should be based onobservation of the evolution of signs and symp toms in groups of patients over time and on theobserved responses of patients to medicines andtreatments. His importance in public health stemsprincipally from his interest in classifying febrilediseases and his study of epidemic patterns offevers in London over many years.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1166,He concludedthat febrile diseases were not merely idiosyncratichumoral responses to environmental stimuli butdistinct species of disease whose expression wasgreatly dependent on atmospheric and seasonalinﬂuences. In treatment Sydenham avoided the heavy use of drugs characteristic of his time challengedprevailing approaches to the treatment of small pox and was a strong advocate of physical exerciseand diet as therapy.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1167,He was perhaps the ﬁrstinﬂuential physician to embrace Peruvian bark quinine in the treatment of ague malaria andone of the ﬁrst to treat anemia with iron. In spite ofhis opposition to academic theorizing and experi mental approaches in medicine he was close tomany of English scientists of the time includingRobert Boyle Christopher Wren Robert Hooke and philosopher John Locke also a physician who was a devoted student of his medical teachings.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1168,SYDENSTRICKER EDGAR 1178Sydenham s unconventional even revolution ary approach to medicine cannot easily be di vorced from his involvement in the seventeenth century Puritan rebellion against the British crown.The Sydenham family Dorsetshire landowners were strong supporters of Parliament and Crom well in the English civil war of the 1640s. All ﬁveSydenham brothers Thomas was the youngest and their father served as ofﬁcers in Cromwell srebel army.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1169,Thomas was wounded two of hisbrothers were killed their mother was murderedby Royalist troops and the eldest brother Wil liam became a leading ﬁgure in Cromwell s pro tectorate. Sydenham s unpopularity with leadingphysicians during the period of Restoration inwhich he practiced may in part have been theconsequence of his political history as well as hislack of a full classical education attributable to theinterruption of his Oxford education by militaryservice.

He wasborn in Shanghai China the son of AmericanPresbyterian missionary parents and educated atFredericksburg College in Virginia.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1172,After workingas a journalist for two years he then studiedpolitical economy at the University of Chicagobefore commencing a lifetime of public healthservice concentrating on the problems of thepoor and the underprivileged. Sydenstricker worked in the United States Public Health Service PHS for the League ofNations and for the Milbank Memorial Fund. Inthe PHS he worked initially with Joseph Goldberger on studies of pellagra then in 1920 he was ap pointed chief of the Ofﬁce of Statistical Investiga tions.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1173,In this ofﬁce he initiated many investiga tions the best known of which was the HagerstownMorbidity Survey which began in 1921. This couldbe regarded as a precursor of the U.S. NationalHealth Survey. Related surveys followed using thesame methods of intermittent or continuous ob servation including surveys on the costs of medi cal care.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1174,In collaboration with the MetropolitanLife Insurance Company he produced detailed statistical analysis of the information contained inthe medical examination records of policy hold ers. In 1923 Sydenstricker developed some ofthese studies at an international level for the Leagueof Nations while on leave from the PHS. During the Great Depression he conducted studies of the effects of poverty and deprivation on health.He died suddenly at age ﬁfty four of a cerebralhemorrhage.

SYPHILIS Syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease STD caused by Treponema pallidum a spirochete that can be transmitted during vaginal anal or oralsex. An estimated 70 000 syphilis cases occur inthe United States annually.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1176,Without treatment syphilis in adults progresses through four stages primary secondary latent and tertiary. Persons with syphilis are most infec tious during the primary and secondary stages.Primary syphilis is marked by an infectious sore chancre that resolves on its own. Without treat ment syphilis bacteria spread through the blood stream and lead to the secondary stage which ischaracterized by a skin rash and systemic symp toms.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1177,These symptoms can come and go over oneto two years during which an infected person can SYSTEMS THINKING 1179infect others. If untreated the infection progresses to a latent stage. Symptoms disappear and thedisease is no longer infectious but the bacteriaremain in the body and can damage vital organs.In about a third of untreated persons the resultsof the internal damage show up years later in thetertiary stage.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1178,Symptoms include paralysis blind ness dementia impotence joint damage heartproblems tumors and deep sores. The damagecan be serious enough to cause death. An un treated pregnant woman in an infectious stage ofsyphilis can pass the infection to her develop ing fetus. Syphilis bacteria can be detected by laboratory examination of material from infectious sores. Asafe accurate and inexpensive blood screeningtest is also available. Syphilis is treatable withpenicillin.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1179,Persons who engage in sexual behaviorsthat place them at risk of STDs should use latex orpolyurethane condoms every time they have sexand limit the number of sex partners.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1181,Systems think ing is especially appropriate in the ﬁeld of publichealth because public health managers and lead ers work in large complex organizations whosesuccess depends upon the cooperation of otherorganizations and institutions. As applied to or ganizations systems thinking was made popularby Peter Senge s 1994 book The Fifth Discipline but a systems approach is also the basis of theoriesin many ﬁelds from biology to psychology.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1182,The central concepts in systems thinking are interconnections feedback and time delays. Sys tems thinking encourages managers to identifythe larger pattern of interconnections or causallinks of which problems are a part. Thus a prob lem to solve is seen as a symptom of an underlyingpattern. Feedback refers to the kind of cause and effect relationship found among system elements.Systems thinking proponents identify two types ofcause and effect relationships reinforcing and bal ancing relations.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1183,An example of a reinforcing rela tionship is when as staff workload increases soalso does job dissatisfaction which leads to absen teeism which in turn leads to even higher work loads. An example of a balancing relation is theshort term solution of rewarding individual highperformers on the staff.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1184,The effect seems to bethat morale improves and absenteeism goes down.The concept of time delays must be factored in however for in the long run individual rewards pit staff members against each other loweringmorale and aggravating the underlying problem which in this case might be excessive workloadsand lack of team development. Interorganizational relations also exhibit sys tem properties.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1185,For example public health manag ers often rely on coalitions of citizens and localorganizations to achieve community health goals.Systems thinking directs the public health man ager s attention to the pattern of interconnectionsbetween organizations and citizen groups thatlead to the success or failure of initiatives.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1190,A series of stud ies by economists demonstrated convincingly thatincreases in cigarette prices driven by increases incigarette taxes reduced cigarette smoking. In par ticular several studies indicated that tax inducedprice increases were particularly effective in dis couraging smoking by young people. Students oftobacco control policy became convinced that taxa tion was one of the most effective tools available topolicy makers to reduce smoking and hence itsenormous toll on human health.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1191,EXCISE TAXES Each of the ﬁfty U.S. states the ten provinces of Canada and their federal governments as well asmost countries throughout the world impose prod uct speciﬁc taxes on cigarettes and less frequently on other tobacco products. Often called excisetaxes product speciﬁc taxes are used sparingly bymost governments. Rather when they tax prod ucts at all they typically do so with a general taxapplied to all products called sales taxes in theUnited States.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1192,Excise taxes are applied most fre quently to three speciﬁc types of products to bacco products alcoholic beverages wine beer and spirits and gasoline. Excise taxes are often motivated by the expec tation that they will yield sizable revenues to gov ernmental units primarily because consumer de mand for such products is relatively insensitive to TAXATION ON TOBACCO 1182their price.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1193,Alternatively or sometimes concur rently excise taxes are motivated by legislators desire to reduce consumption of products deemedby society to be undesirable. Thus in the case ofcigarettes and alcoholic beverages excise taxes aresometimes referred to as sin taxes. EFFECTS OF CIGARETTE TAXES Historically cigarette excise taxation has been motivated by both concerns. The demand forcigarettes is only modestly responsive to pricechanges.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1194,The consensus estimate is that in devel oped countries for every 10 percent increase inprice the quantity of cigarettes demanded byconsumers will fall by about 4 percent. When oneconsiders however that cigarette taxes constituteonly a fraction of total cigarette price one realizesthat large increases in cigarette tax rates can simul taneously generate signiﬁcant increases in govern mental revenues and a substantial decrease insmoking.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1195,Thus tobacco taxation gives govern ments the opportunity to do well in terms ofenriching their treasuries while improving pub lic health. Studies suggest that smoking by young people is especially sensitive to cigarette price increases.In general the older the age group considered theless price responsive it appears to be. This makesconsiderable intuitive sense because compared toyounger smokers older smokers tend to be moreaddicted and to have more disposable income tospend on cigarettes.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1196,The general consensus is thatyouth are approximately twice as price responsiveas adults. Thus a 10 percent increase in cigaretteprice should decrease smoking by youth by about8 percent. As a consequence many legislators andpublic health policy makers have called for in creased cigarette taxation as a means of discourag ing youth smoking. By the end of the twentieth century virtually all comprehensive tobacco control plans have in cluded substantial increases in tobacco taxes as afundamental component.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1197,Such plans call for in creases in cigarette taxes as a means of both dis couraging children from smoking and raising fundsto pay for other tobacco control measures such anantismoking education. In addition to being aneffective deterrent to youth smoking cigarettetaxation offers an attractive political feature Pro posed cigarette tax increases are often popularwith voters including many smokers especially when the revenues generated by the tax increases are directed toward prevention of youth smoking.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1198,LIMITATIONS Tobacco taxation is not devoid of controversy however. Whenever a tobacco tax increase is pro posed opponents argue that the tax increase willbe regressive imposing a larger ﬁnancial burdenon the poor than on the rich. This is especially truebecause larger proportions of the poor populationsmoke than of the rich. The more highly educatedpopulation which tends to be more afﬂuent aswell has quit smoking in dramatic numbers inresponse to health education messages concern ing the dangers of smoking.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1199,Although the regressivity argument merits se rious consideration its importance should not beexaggerated. The impact is blunted by the factthat low income smokers are more price respon sive than high income smokers thus giving upsmoking and its concomitant impact on disease in greater proportions than is the case amongthe rich. In public health circles this progres sively distributed health beneﬁt is viewed as amplejustiﬁcation to promote increased tobacco taxa tion wherever and whenever possible.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1203,These ﬁgures include live births ac counting for approximately half of the total of900 000 induced abortions and fetal losses dueto miscarriages and still births. In 1996 the pregnancy rate was twice as high among non Hispanic black and Hispanic teens asamong non Hispanic white teens. By 2003 theunder 18 Hispanic and non Hispanic black popu lation will be greater than 50 percent of the adoles cent population. These ﬁgures are important inplanning pregnancy prevention programs.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1204,Teen pregnancy is one serious consequence of early initiation of sexual activity. Other seriousconsequences include an increased likelihood oflate or no prenatal care unattended births re duced educational attainment and decreased em ployment opportunities. Infants of teenage moth ers are at greater risk of low birth weight andincreased infant mortality. Thirteen percent ofinfants born to 15 year olds have a low birthweight compared to 7 percent of infants born tomothers in their twenties.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1205,Infants of mothers 13 to14 years old have an infant mortality rate of 17 per1000 live births compared to the rate of 10 per1000 live births for those 15 to 19 years old and arate of only 4.5 per 1000 live births for all mothersin the United States. Children of teenage mothersare more likely to perform poorly in school morelikely to drop out of school and less likely toattend college. Overall problems related to teenpregnancies cost taxpayers an estimated 7 billionper year.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1206,After three decades of steady increases the proportion of teenagers 15 to 19 years old whowere sexually active decreased by 50 percent dur ing the mid 1990s. In addition condom use at ﬁrstintercourse increased from 18 percent in 1975 to54 percent in 1995. Socioeconomic factors and limited life op tions rather than ethnic or cultural background place many youth at higher risk for unintended pregnancy.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1207,Early attempts at preventing teen preg nancies often ignored the complex relationshipbetween development environment and behav ior. Neither those programs that focus on increas ing knowledge nor abstinence only programs havebeen effective in reducing the rate of unintendedpregnancies. Adolescent behaviors are shaped bythe desire to broaden horizons interact with peers or try out adult roles and behaviors.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1208,If early sexualbehavior is the only perceived option to achievethese objectives teens may well choose it. As our society moves forward a more compre hensive approach to reducing adolescent preg nancy is needed. Many risk behaviors includingearly and unprotected intercourse are linked andshare common motivations. Programs designed toprevent pregnancy need to address these otherbehaviors as well.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1209,A variety of life choices need tobe available for teens and programs need to ad dress real economic barriers if the unintendedteen pregnancy rate in the United States is to bereduced.

The effectsof teratogenic compounds are time dependent aswell as dose dependent.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1212,Time dependency is afunction of the differences in development ofparticular organs and systems during pregnancy.The original deﬁnition of teratogens was narrowand referred to those chemicals drugs and dis eases that led to structural and functional abnor malities observed in early life. The classic thera peutic human teratogen is thalidomide.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1213,This drug a sedative developed in the late 1950s and early1960s induced serious birth defects in babieswhose mothers had taken the drug during thecritical period of organogenesis of the limbs sec ond trimester of pregnancy . The babies wereborn with several defects including missing orstumped limbs phocomelia cleft palate and lip and other defects.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1214,This abnormality affected over10 000 babies worldwide and led to the testing ofall new drugs and eventually some pesticides andcommodity chemicals for teratogenic potential.Several maternal diseases such as German mea sles hypothyroidism and syphilis to name a few are teratogenic. The deﬁnition of a teratogen has been ex panded as knowledge increases about the mecha nism of action of additional chemicals.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1215,A broaderdeﬁnition of a teratogen now encompasses defectsother than simply structural changes and includes the transplacental carcinogen diethylstilbestrol. Of great import are the retinoic acid deriva tives such as 13 cis retinoic acid that remain teratogenic years after a woman has taken thedrug.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1216,This type of teratogen is very difﬁcult topredict from animal studies and the scientiﬁc com munity must rely on mechanistic studies to as sess risk.Since the central nervous system including the brain completes development after birth latepregnancy exposure to many toxicants can haveserious adverse effects on the developing nervous system.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1219,EXAMPLES OF TERRORISM Use or threat of use of violence has long caused concern among those responsible for public health. Examples include indiscriminate violence such asthe 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center inNew York City and the 1995 bombing of theFederal Building in Oklahoma City and targetedviolence such as attacks on facilities for the termi nation of pregnancy or on those who work insuch facilities.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1221,Recent instances of use or threatened use of biological or chemical agents in terrorism have TERRORISM 1185raised interest in the role of public health agencies and public health personnel in primary or second ary prevention. Documented episodes althoughextremely rare have been dramatic. In Japan thechemical warfare agent Sarin was released by theAum Shinrikyo cult in Matsumoto in 1994 and inthe Tokyo subway in 1995. In 1984 an Oregon cultallegedly contaminated salad bars with a biologicalagent salmonella.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1222,These episodes and recenthoaxes concerning anthrax release have led towell publicized costly responses by public healthand public safety ofﬁcials. Chemical terrorism couldinclude the purposeful contamination of water and food supplies or the aerosolization of toxi cants within enclosed public spaces. Biological terrorist actions could include purposeful con tamination with infectious materials as well as thepurposeful release of insects or other vectors in fected with a transmissible disease.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1223,AVAILABILITY OF CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS Underlying concern about bioterrorism is the long history of use of chemical and biological weapons CBW in war. Since World War II worldwidemilitary forces have built up major stockpiles ofsuch weapons and tested them at a number of sitesaround the world.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1224,Although the Biological Weap ons Convention BWC and the Chemical Weap ons Convention CWC outlawed the develop ment production stockpiling and transfer of theseweapons large stockpiles of chemical weaponsstill await destruction in several nations and it isalleged that stockpiles of biological weapons arestill maintained in a few nations. Although thetechnical knowledge and materials needed to pro duce CBW are relatively available the ability to weaponize and target these materials remainsextremely limited.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1225,The risk of their use appears tobe small but any use constitutes a threat to pub lic health. TYPES OF BIOLOGICAL AGENTS There are at least seventy types of bacteria viruses rickettsiae and fungi that can be weaponized including tularemia anthrax Q fever epidemictyphus smallpox brucellosis Venezuelan equineencephalitis botulinum toxin dengue fever Rus sian spring summer encephalitis Lassa fever Marburg Ebola Bolivian hemorrhagic fever Machupo and Argentinean hemorrhagic fever Junin .
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1226,Antibiotic resistant strains of anthrax plague tularemia and glanders have allegedlybeen developed. Viruses and toxins can be geneti cally altered to heighten their infectiousness per mitting the development of pathogens capable of overcoming existing vaccines. It is estimated thatno more than 20 to 30 percent of the diseases theaforementioned agents cause can be effectivelytreated.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1227,RECENT HISTORY OF CONTROL In 1994 U.S. president Bill Clinton issued an Execu tive Order asserting that the potential use of nu clear biological and chemical weapons by terror ist groups or rogue states represents an unusualand extraordinary threat to the national security foreign policy and economy of the United States. This Order renewed annually makes it illegal foranyone in the United States to help anyone toacquire design produce or stockpile CBW.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1228,TheOrder was amended in 1998 to include penaltiesfor trafﬁcking in equipment that could indirectlycontribute to a foreign biological warfare program. In 1995 President Clinton announced a new policy against superterrorism terrorism involv ing weapons of mass destruction.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1229,The Depart ments of Defense Energy and State together withthe FBI and the CIA were to oversee a widenetwork of military and civilian agencies includ ing the Centers for Disease Control and Preven tion dedicated to identifying CBW attacks and tocoping with their consequences.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1230,In 1997 a 52.6million Domestic Preparedness Program was au thorized for emergency response teams in 120selected cities whereby police ﬁre departments and public health ofﬁcials were to receive specialtraining and equipment to help them combat bio logical and chemical terrorism. In 1998 President Clinton announced new initiatives to address bioterrorism.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1231,Hearings be fore a committee of the U.S. Senate in 1998 in cluded witnesses who stated that such proposalswere misguided because so many resources werebeing assigned to military rather than to medicalor public health authorities. Ethical questions raisedinclude whether such funds could be better spenton providing adequate public health measures TERTIARY PREVENTION 1186preventive medicine and treatment for endemic illness to the population.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1232,LIMITATIONS OF COUNTER TERRORISM MEASURES Overall there is little evidence that speciﬁc vac cine programs or other technical defensive pro grams are effective or ethical preventive measuresagainst the use or threat of use of biologic weap ons.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1233,Many public health experts argue that the bestdefenses against use of biological weapons lie inethical proscription of work on them by healthprofessionals and scientists and protection of theglobal population against all serious infectiousdisease not just diseases caused intentionally byameliorating poverty and inadequate nutrition housing and education.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1234,As part of this effort it is argued industrial ized countries should enable developing countriesto build capacity for detection diagnosis andtreatment of all disease by providing technicalinformation and needed resources. Article X ofthe BWC encouraging the exchange of informa tion and materials for peaceful purposes shouldbe strengthened.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1235,Research organizations profes sional societies and individual scientists shouldpledge not to engage knowingly in research orteaching that furthers the development and use ofbiological weapons. Furthermore all countriescould prohibit the development of novel biologi cal agents that do not have an unambiguouslypeaceful purpose even if these activities are pro moted for defensive purposes.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1236,An important reason that a few nations groups or individuals may continue to develop or stock pile chemical or biological weapons known as thepoor nation s nuclear weapons lies in the massivestockpiles of nuclear weapons maintained by theUnited States and other nuclear powers. As long asthese nations fail to recognize their obligationsunder the 1970 Nuclear Non Proliferation Treatyto move expeditiously toward nuclear weaponsabolition biological and chemical weapons willremain a threat.

In industrialized coun tries tetanus primarily affects elderly adults whilein developing countries neonatal tetanus predomi nates and is a substantial major contributor toinfant mortality.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1246,Elimination of tetanus especiallyneonatal tetanus through vaccination is a global public health priority. CLINICAL DESCRIPTION Tetanus lockjaw is an acute neurologic disease that occurs when C. tetani spores infect a site of injury and produce a neurotoxin. Wounds accom panied by tissue injury and necrosis produce theanaerobic conditions necessary for bacterial repli cation and toxin production. The diagnosis isusually established clinically and supported by theepidemiologic setting.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1247,Major symptoms are spasmof the muscles of mastication trismus or lockjaw and generalized hyperreﬂexia which producespainful and uncontrollable muscular contractions.Generalized spasms can occur often induced byexternal sensory stimuli. The incubation periodranges from two days to two months with anaverage of ten days. The course of illness may lastseveral weeks often requiring intubation andsubsides gradually in survivors. The case fatality rate ranges between 10 and 90 percent.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1248,Survival is correlated with longer incu bation periods and access to medical care. Shorterincubation periods are usually associated with heav ily contaminated wounds more serious disease and worse outcomes. A wound history can beestablished in approximately 80 percent of tetanuspatients in the United States however absence ofa wound does not rule out tetanus. Laboratoryconﬁrmation of tetanus is difﬁcult and may not bedeﬁnitive. Culture of the wound may rarely yieldC.

Neonatal tetanus NT is caused by unsanitary conditions during childbirth speciﬁcally contami nation of the umbilical stump. Neonatal tetanuscan be prevented by education about the need forclean deliveries and immunization of women ofchildbearing age including pregnant women .
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1250,EPIDEMIOLOGY Clostridium tetani is a normal inhabitant of soil and of animal and human intestines and occurs world wide. Cases increase during warmer months intemperate climates most likely because of increasedoutdoor activity. In the United States an average TETRACHLOROETHYLENE 1188of forty six tetanus cases per year were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC from 1990 to 1999 as compared to anaverage of sixty seven cases in the 1980s.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1251,In developing countries neonatal tetanus is a leading cause of neonatal mortality accountingfor over 250 000 deaths annually. Neonatal teta nus has been called the silent killer since infantsoften die before their birth is recorded. CONTROL MEASURES In the United States ﬁve doses of tetanus toxoid are recommended at 2 4 6 and 18 months andbetween 4 and 6 years of age most often adminis tered with diphtheria toxoid and acellular pertussisvaccine DTaP .
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1252,Subsequent booster shots for teta nus combined with diphtheria toxoid are recom mended every ten years. Less than one percent oftetanus cases recently reported in the United Stateswere in persons with up to date immunizations.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1259,THEORIES OF HEALTH AND ILLNESS 1189THEORIES OF HEALTH AND ILLNESS Theories about health and illness deal with the ideas people use to explain how to maintain ahealthy state and why they become ill. Ideas aboutillness causation may include such ideas as breachof taboo soul loss germs upset in the hot coldbalance of the body or a weakening of the body simmune system.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1260,Theories of illness causation de rive from the underlying cognitive orientation of acultural group and therapeutic practice usuallyfollows the same cultural logic. Anthropologists often divide theories of ill ness into two broad categories personalistic andnaturalistic. In a personalistic system illness isbelieved to be caused by the intervention of asensate agent who may be a supernatural being adeity or dead ancestor or a human being withspecial powers a witch or a sorcerer .
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1261,The sickperson s illness is considered to be a direct resultof the malign inﬂuence of these agents. In natural istic causation illness is explained in impersonalterms. When the body is in balance with the natu ral environment a state of health prevails. How ever when that balance is disturbed illness results.Often people invoke both types of causation inexplaining an episode of illness and treatmentmay entail two corresponding types of therapy.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1262,According to personalistic theories of illness illness may be linked to transgressions of a moraland spiritual nature. If someone has violated asocial norm or breached a religious taboo he orshe may invoke the wrath of a deity and sickness as a form of divine punishment may result. Pos session by evil spirits is also thought to be a causeof illness in many cultures.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1263,This may be due toinappropriate behavior on the part of the patient failure to carry out the proper rituals of respect fora dead ancestor for example or it may be simplydue to bad luck. Sometimes one person s envy ofanother s good fortune is believed to exert a ma lign inﬂuence through the evil eye which canresult in illness or other calamities. Witches andsorcerers are malevolent human beings who ma nipulate secret rituals and charms to bring calam ity upon their enemies.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1264,Recovery from an illnessarising from personalistic causes usually involvesthe use of ritual and symbolism most often bypractitioners who are specially trained in these arts.Naturalistic theories of disease causation tend to view health as a state of harmony between ahuman being and his or her environment whenthis balance is upset illness will result. The humoralsystem is a naturalistic approach to illness whoseroots are over two thousand years old.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1265,Humoralconcepts of health and illness are widely found inIndia southeast Asia China and in a somewhatdifferent form in Latin and South America. Main taining humoral balance involves attention to ap propriate diet and activity including regulatingone s diet according to the seasons. Illnesses maybe categorized into those due to excess heat andthose due to excess cold. Treatment of an illness ofoverheat would involve measures such as givingcooling foods and application of cool compresses.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1266,In India the ancient system of Ayurveda is based on naturalistic ideas of illness causation.Therapy in Ayurveda includes a vast pharmacopeiaof preparations made from herbs and minerals and dietary advice also forms part of every pre scription. Ayurveda is actively practised in Indiatoday and has shaped the way Indians think abouttheir bodies in health and in illness. An important set of theories about health and illness often called vitalist theories is widespreadin China South Asia and Southeast Asia.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1267,Whenvital forces within the body ﬂow in a harmonious pattern a positive state of health is maintained. Illness results when this smooth ﬂow of energy isdisrupted and therapeutic measures are aimed atrestoring a normal ﬂow of energy in the body. InChina this vital force is known as chi in India it iscalled prana. In China the ancient art of acu puncture is based on this understanding of thebody. Acupuncture needles are inserted at variouspoints along the meridians or energy orienta tions of the body.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1268,The stimulation of the needleshelps to restore a proper ﬂow of energy within thebody. In India yoga particularly hatha yoga thephysical form of yoga is used therapeutically torestore a balanced energy ﬂow through bodyand mind. Biomedicine modern traditional medicine is founded on a naturalistic set of theories about the body and these theories are continually evolv ing. One of the core theories of contemporarybiomedicine the germ theory of disease is ofrelatively recent origin.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1269,According to an olderbiomedical concept the miasma theory of disease THEORY OF PLANNED BEHAVIOR 1190poisonous emanations from rotting vegetation or carcasses were believed to cause disease.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1270,The body as machine metaphor hasbeen a powerful way of conceptualizing the bodywithin biomedicine and a core assumption of thevalue system of biomedicine is that diagnosis andtreatment should be based on scientiﬁc data. How ever treatment approaches are often not rigor ously analyzed scientiﬁcally before being employedtherapeutically.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1271,For example angina pectoris hasbeen treated in a variety of ways including with theuse of xanthines khellin vitamin E ligation of theinternal mammary artery and implantation of thisartery.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1273,Surgical treatments suchas coronary bypass surgery employ complex equip ment and are performed in specialized settings.These settings and equipment all have powerfulsymbolic associations as well as technical func tions. Rituals are patterned forms of behavior thathave symbolic signiﬁcance that often help to pro vide a context of meaning in a strange or frighten ing situation.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1274,Both patients who undergo the sur gery and surgeons who perform the surgery areinvolved in rituals that serve to order a life changingevent i.e. major surgery . The processes of ob taining informed consent getting a patient preppedfor surgery and complex stages of post operativecare all have ritual as well as technical functions. Alternative therapies also called complemen tary therapies have been rapidly gaining in popu larity worldwide.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1275,These therapies are diverse rang ing from traditional treatments adapted from theirlands of origin such as acupuncture and shiatsu to newly developed forms of therapy such as thera peutic touch. Many alternative therapies have un derlying theories of illness causation that are quitedifferent from that of biomedicine. In therapiessuch as acupuncture reiki and shiatsu the conceptof vital energy or chi is the basis for the practice.Successful therapy is that which regulates and harmonizes energy ﬂows.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1276,In iridology particularareas on the iris of the eye are thought to corre spond to speciﬁc body organs and a diagnosis ofmalfunction of the organs can be made by anexamination of the iris. Conceptually this theoryof illness links to an ancient philosophical systemof homologies that makes connections betweenthe cosmic and the terrestrial between the outerenvironment and the inner and between the ex ternal body and the internal body.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1277,All theories of health and illness serve to cre ate a context of meaning within which the patientcan make sense of his or her bodily experience. Ameaningful context for illness usually reﬂects corecultural values and allows the patient to bringorder to the chaotic world of serious illness and toregain some sense of control in a frighteningsituation.

THREE MILE ISLAND The most serious nuclear reactor accident to date in the United States occurred at 4 A.M. on March 28 1979 at the Three Mile Island nuclear powerplant outside Middletown Pennsylvania. Opera tor errors in dealing with a pump that had shutdown caused the Unit 2 pressurized water reactorto lose coolant and overheat.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1285,The temperature ofthe reactor core then rose to the point at whichsome of the zirconium alloy fuel cladding failed fuel itself partially melted and cladding reactedwith steam to produce bubbles of vapor and hy drogen which then escaped into the reactor build ing along with ﬁssion products from the reactorcore.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1286,As a result of the failure to close a backupvalve that could be operated manually coolant wasnot restored to the reactor core until more than sixhours after the accident by which time enoughhydrogen had accumulated in the building to posethe treat of a low level explosion. The building hadbeen designed to seal automatically in the event ofa pressure rise but no rise occurred and fourhours were allowed to elapse before the buildingwas sealed during which time radioactive gasesescaped into the atmosphere.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1287,Within three hours after the ﬁrst sign of trou ble elevated radiation levels were detected bymonitors in the reactor auxiliary building. A siteemergency was declared and ofﬁcials enlisted theaid of local state and federal emergency person nel. The presence of a large hydrogen bubble inthe reactor vessel prompted widespread fear thatthe reactor might explode a concern that expertsfailed to allay although they knew it to be a misap prehension.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1288,Adding to the fear dosimeter read ings made in a helicopter three hundred feetabove the auxiliary building s ventilation stackwere misinterpreted by ofﬁcials to signify elevatedground levels of radiation prompting the gover nor of Pennsylvania to recommend the evacuationof all pregnant women and preschool childrenresiding within ﬁve miles of the plant who thencomplied.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1289,Although large amounts of radiation were released the resulting exposure of the public wasrelatively slight resulting mainly from xenon 133 THRESHOLD 1192that was present in the gaseous plume.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1290,The largest dose of radiation any member of the public mayhave received is estimated to have been smallerthan his or her annual dose from natural back ground irradiation and the average dose to thoseliving within ﬁfty miles of the reactor is estimatedto have been 40 to 50 times smaller than that.Because of the small magnitude of the doses thatwere received no demonstrable injuries from theradiation were expected nor have any actually been observed.

THRESHOLD A threshold is the exposure level or dose of an agent above which toxicity or adverse health ef fects can occur and below which toxicity or ad verse health effects are unlikely.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1293,For example taking aspirin is therapeutic and not dangerous upto a contain dose but above that dose it can causenausea brain damage bleeding and eventually death. Sulfuric acid is not dangerous when onlysmall amounts of it get on a person s skin but ifthe amount gets too high it burns. Thresholds fortoxicity exist because up to a certain point thebody can repair damage and detoxify chemicals towhich it is exposed.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1294,If the exposures get too high however the detoxiﬁcation and repair mecha nisms are overwhelmed and toxicity starts to occur.Thresholds for toxicity can be different in different people with some people likely to besensitive to smaller levels of exposures than oth ers. In other words toxicity thresholds are distrib uted differently within a population. For example some people can breathe a lot of paint stripperwithout feeling ill while others get sick from itquite easily.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1295,So while it may be easy to demonstratea chemical s threshold for toxicity in identicallaboratory animals a threshold for toxicity in adiverse human population may be very difﬁcult todetermine. The concept of a threshold for toxicity has played an important role in chemical regulation.Until recently chemicals that cause cancer wereassumed to have no threshold for their effects while chemicals that cause other kinds of healtheffects were assumed to have thresholds.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1296,It is nowknown that some cancer causing chemicals havethresholds and some other toxic agents do not and this knowledge is slowly making its way intoregulatory guidelines. An example of a nonregulatory guideline that is based on toxicity thresholds is the thresholdlimit value TLV . TLVs were derived as chemi cal exposure levels that are permissible in theworkplaces if workplace exposures stay belowthe TLVs workers are unlikely to be adverselyaffected.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1297,TLVs were established ﬁrst in 1968 bya nongovernmental organization known as theAmerican Conference of Governmental IndustrialHygienists ACGIH based on available scientiﬁcinformation and best professional judgment.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1300,New York Van Nostrand Reinhold Co. THYROID DISORDERS Thyroid disorders fall into two general categories 1 dysfunction of thyroid hormone production and 2 development of thyroid enlargements called goiters which include generalized enlarge ment of the gland and benign and malignantnodules. Thyroid dysfunction results either fromincreased or decreased secretion of thyroid hor mones called hyperthyroidism or hypothyroid ism respectively.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1301,NORMAL THYROID FUNCTION The principal role of the thyroid gland is to manu facture store and secrete the thyroid hormones l thyroxine and l triiodothyronine. A critical andunique component of these hormones is theiriodine content 4 atoms of iodine per molecule forl thyroxine T4 and 3 atoms per molecule for l triiodothyronine T3 .
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1302,Iodine is a trace elementin the crust of the earth and the thyroid hasevolved mechanisms to concentrate iodine fromthe blood plasma and retain it for the manufac ture of the thyroid hormones. Once made thehormones are stored within a protein molecule called thyroglobulin within tiny follicles that arelined with thyroid cells. In a controlled manner thyroglobulin is taken back into the thyroid cells degraded by enzymes and the thyroid hormonethat is released is secreted into the circulating blood.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1303,Function of the thyroid gland uniquely and absolutely requires thyroid stimulating hormone TSH also known as thyrotroptin which is se creted by speciﬁc cells in the anterior pituitarygland. Secretion of TSH is also negatively con trolled by the blood concentrations of thyroidhormones. In this classic negative feedback sys tem excessive serum concentrations of thyroidhormones decrease secretion of TSH and de creased serum thyroid hormones increase serumTSH.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1304,In the normal individual the serum concen trations both of TSH and thyroid hormones arewithin the normal range. THYROID DYSFUNCTION Thyroid hormones regulate the rate of metabo lism heat production and oxygen consumptionof the entire organism as well as the concentrationof speciﬁc proteins in different organs and tissues.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1305,In general symptoms of thyroid dysfunction are related to changes in the rate of metabolism andheat production though changes in speciﬁc pro teins may also have a profound impact in the body.For example since thyroid hormones regulate theproduction of growth hormone growth hormoneconcentration decreases in the setting of hypo thyroidism resulting in cessation of growth inhypothyroid children. Hyperthyroidism.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1306,In hyperthyroidism also called thyrotoxicosis excessive concentrations ofthyroid hormones circulate through the body af fecting most tissues and organs and producing a hypermetabolic state.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1307,In this setting patients com plain of fatigue and the feeling that their bodytemperature is too warm they have increasedsensitivity to external heat and a rapid heartbeat called palpitations and they have increased andinappropriate perspiration nervousness excessenergy tremors and an increased frequency ofbowel movements. On examination patients havewarm moist skin tremor heat radiating fromtheir skin rapid heartbeat and an abnormal thy roid examination.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1308,These symptoms reﬂect an in crease in heat production and metabolic rate.Such patients are at increased risk for danger ous abnormal rhythms of the heart atrial ﬁbrilla tion muscle weakness and loss of calcium fromthe bones. In the United States the incidence of hyper thyroidism is about 0.5 to 1.0 percent in adultpopulations and in patients older than 70 years itapproaches 1 to 2 percent.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1309,The most common THYROID DISORDERS 1194cause of hyperthyroidism is Graves disease an autoimmune disorder that may occur in multiplegenerations particularly in women. The inherit ance appears to be a susceptibility to develop theautoimmune disorder and its expression is likelyinﬂuenced by environmental factors. In this disor der antibodies that appear in the circulation bindto the protein receptor of TSH on the surface ofthyroid cells.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1310,Once bound the antibody calledthyroid stimulating immunoglobulin simulates thestimulatory action of TSH. Unlike TSH however the antibody is not negatively regulated by thyroidhormones and it provides continuous stimulationof the thyroid leading to overproduction and se cretion of excessive amounts of thyroid hormones.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1311,Another cause of hyperthyroidism particu larly in middle aged or older individuals is benignthyroid tumors that produce thyroid hormones even in the absence of TSH called Plummer sdisease or toxic thyroid adenoma. The TSH independence of the thyroid tissue in these tu mors which may be single or multiple is likely dueto mutations in the TSH receptor protein or otherproteins involved in transmission of the TSH sig nal into the cell.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1312,A third common cause of hyperthyroidism is thyroiditis caused either by an aberration ofthe immune system in patients with chronicautoimmune thyroiditis or by a viral infection. Inthese disorders the thyroid is not hyperfunctioning rather the structure of the thyroid is disturbed byinﬂammation and the hormones essentially leakout of the gland and enter the circulation in anunregulated manner.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1313,The latter conditions areself limited and the hyperthyroidism persists onlyas long as previously manufactured and storedthyroid hormone remains in the thyroid. Otherrelatively rare causes of hyperthyroidism are pitui tary tumors that secrete TSH in an unregulatedmanner and very high concentrations of the nor mal placental hormone chorionic gonadotropin that may occur in a small minority of pregnanciesor in tumors called choriocarcinoma.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1314,The treatments employed for hyperthyroid ism are dependent on their cause. For example the hyperthyroidism that occurs during pregnancydue to excessive chorionic gonadotropin resolvesafter pregnancy is over. Hyperthyroidism due toTSH secreting tumors of the pituitary are treatedby removal of those tumors and the hyperthyroid ism associated with thyroiditis is self limited andpersists only as long as previously manufacturedthyroid hormones persist in the thyroid gland.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1315,For the common causes Graves disease and functioning thyroid tumors available treatmentsinclude use of antithyroid drugs methimizole andpropylthiouracil radioactive iodine I 131 andsurgery. The antithyroid drugs decrease produc tion of thyroid hormone and restore patients to anormal metabolic state.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1316,The natural history ofGraves disease includes remission in 25 percent ofpatients in North America 35 50 percent inEurope 50 60 percent in Japan so that control ofthe disease with antithyroid drugs looking forwardto a possible remission is a reasonable approachfor many patients. For those who do not enterremission destructive treatment is usually recom mended and accomplished by surgery subtotalthyroidectomy or by administration of radioac tive iodine.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1317,The latter has been in use since the1940s and is safe and effective. It has none of theimmediate side effects or long term risks that areusually attributed to radiation. Functioning thy roid tumors that are associated with hyperthyroid ism do not resolve spontaneously and are there fore usually treated by surgery or radioactive iodineadministration. Hypothyroidism. In hypothyroidism serum concentrations of thyroid hormones are decreased resulting in a hypometabolic state.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1318,In this setting patients complain of fatigue and sleepiness andthe feeling that their body temperature is low andthey have increased sensitivity to the cold and thefeeling that mental function is slow. Appetite re mains normal but body weight may increase mod estly. Cramping pain in the muscles and constipa tion are common. On examination skin is dry andcool and the hair may be brittle. Patients have a slow heart rate hoarse voice and slowed mentalfunction.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1319,Swelling around the eyes occurs and the reﬂexes are abnormal. Such patients also haveraised concentrations of cholesterol in the bloodplasma and are at increased risk for heart disease. The incidence of hypothyroidism in the United States is 1 to 2 percent in patients under ﬁfty yearsof age and then increases with age.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1320,In women whoare older than seventy years of age moderate tosevere hypothyroidism occurs in 2 to 4 percent THYROID DISORDERS 1195and a milder form of hypothyroidism sometimes called subclinical hypothyroidism occurs in about10 percent. Hypothyroidism occurs in males at anincidence that is about 25 percent that of females.Congenital hypothyroidism occurs in 1 in 3 500births and can be determined by hormone meas urements in one drop of blood.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1321,If treated soonafter birth affected children appear to developquite normally. However in untreated infants brain development is severely impaired resultingin cretinism. A common cause of hypothyroidism is Hashimoto s disease an autoimmune disorder ofthe thyroid that is closely related to Graves dis ease. Both disorders occur in multiple generationsin the same family particularly in women andinvolve an immune response within the thyroidgland and the appearance of antibodies in theblood plasma.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1322,In Hashimoto s disease antibodies that can be easily measured are directed againstthyroglobulin and another thyroid protein thy roid peroxidase. The immune inﬂammation of thethyroid is painless and involves gradual replace ment of thyroid tissue with lymphocytes and ﬁ brous scar tissue.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1323,Other causes of hypothyroidism include surgi cal removal of the gland in the course of treatmentof thyroid nodules goiter and cancer destructionof the thyroid by radioactive iodine I 131 whichoccurs commonly after the use of the isotope forthe treatment of Graves disease and hyperthy roidism due to hyperfunctioning thyroid nodules.Diseases of the hypothalamus and pituitary thatresult in insufﬁcient TSH for normal thyroid func tion can also cause hypothyroidism.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1324,Finally areasin the world that still suffer from iodine deﬁciencyhave a high incidence of hypothyroidism and goi ter. The diagnosis of hypothyroidism can be eas ily conﬁrmed by measurements of thyroid hor mones and TSH. Treatment of hypothyroidism is straightfor ward in comparison to treatment of hyperthyroid ism. No matter what the cause the ramiﬁcations ofthe disease result from deﬁciency of thyroid hor mone.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1325,Thus simple once a day treatment withthyroid hormone restores the body s thyroid hor mone to normal relieves all symptoms and signs of disease and prevents the long term sequelae ofhypothyroidism. Most physicians prescribe syn thetic l thyroxine to accomplish this goal.Goiters and Nodules. Goiter is an enlarge ment of the thyroid gland.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1326,When all of the thyroidtissue is enlarged called a diffuse goiter the causemay be manifold including Graves or Hashimoto sdisease congenital goiter and iodine deﬁciency inthose areas of the world where iodine intake isparticularly low. Goiter is therefore a reﬂection ofa disease process and may occur with or withoutthyroid dysfunction. Once the cause of goiter isdetermined speciﬁc treatment can be prescribed.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1327,Goiter is frequently caused by lumps or nod ules in the thyroid which may be cysts inﬂamma tion or benign or malignant tumors. The physi cian can feel single or multiple nodules in 4 to 7percent of the adult population in the UnitedStates. Nodules are found at a much higher fre quency by applying ultrasound sonography orcomputerized tomography to the thyroid area.Similar to other thyroid diseases most patients arefemale.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1328,Current estimates are that the annual inci dence of thyroid nodules discovered by examina tion is about 0.1 percent of the adult population.However the annual incidence of thyroid canceris about 0.004 percent. Therefore only about onein twenty newly discovered thyroid nodules are likely to be malignant. Upon discovery of a thyroid nodules s the physician s main concern should be to determinewhether the nodule is benign or malignant.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1329,Thecornerstone for this determination is the ﬁne needle aspiration biopsy a procedure in which avery ﬁne needle is inserted directly through theskin into the nodule and with gentle suction cellsfrom the nodule are aspirated placed on glassslides stained and evaluated by microscopy. Thebiopsy done with or without direct visualizationby sonography is a simple safe and relativelypainless ofﬁce procedure. The sensitivity for de tection of thyroid cancer is about 85 percent andthe speciﬁcty is about 92 percent.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1330,Cytology resultsin a diagnosis in 85 percent of samples with 75percent being benign 5 percent being malignantand 20 percent suspicious for malignancy. Theremaining samples are nondiagnostic or unsatis factory samples. The experience of the operatorand cytologist has a large inﬂuence on these results.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1331,When the aspiration biopsy demonstrates thy roid cancer patients are usually referred for totalthyroidectomy and are also frequently treated with THYROID FUNCTION TESTS 1196radioactive iodine I 131 as well as l thyroxine at doses that at least maintain normal thyroid func tion. The nature of most thyroid cancers and thesuccess of these treatments usually result in alifetime cure rate that is greater than 90 percent.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1332,Treatments for benign thyroid nodules vary according to their cause size location and rate ofgrowth. Some nodules may require no treatmentat all whereas others may require surgical excisionbecause they cause pressure on vital structureswithin the neck such as the windpipe trachea food tube esophagus or blood vessels.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1343,Thesituation is particularly tragic given that the harmcaused by tobacco use has been known by themedical and public health communities as well asby the tobacco industry for nearly half a century and that the means to reduce tobacco use are wellknown and relatively inexpensive and cost effective.THE HARM CAUSED BY TOBACCO USE In the United States cigarette smoking is responsi ble for over one in ﬁve deaths over 400 000 deathsa year with an annual loss of over 5 million yearsof life.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1344,Globally about 3 to 4 million people dieevery year as a result of tobacco use primarily inthe developed world. The World Health Organiza tion WHO projects that if current trends intobacco use continue through to 2030 approxi mately 10 million people around the world will dieeach year the majority in developing countries which can ill afford the health costs of tobacco related illness and the associated loss of productivity.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1345,It is estimated that one out of two lifelong smokers will have their lives shortened as a resultof their addiction to tobacco products.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1346,On aver age a death caused by smoking robs about twelveyears of life from the smoker compared to the lifeexpectancy of a person who has never smoked.While there is a substantial lag time from thebeginning of tobacco use to the usual manifesta tion of symptoms the death and disease caused bysmoking is not limited to the older age groups.Cigarette smoking is a major killer of those inmiddle age ages forty ﬁve to sixty four and it isestimated that 80 percent of coronary heart dis ease deaths in this age group are caused by ciga rette smoking.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1347,Tobacco use causes a panoply of diseases affecting nearly all vital organ systems. Diseases ofthe pulmonary and cardiovascular systems pre dominate with heart cancer and respiratory dis eases being most common. In the United Stateseach year smoking causes 155 000 cancer deaths 122 000 cardiovascular deaths and 72 000 chroniclung disease deaths along with 81 000 deaths fromother causes. Among all diseases smokers are now most likely to die of lung cancer 123 000 deaths a year .
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1348,This is true for both men and women withlung cancer recently surpassing breast cancer asthe leading cause of cancer death among U.S.women. The magnitude of the lung cancer burdenis particularly tragic given that in the beginning ofthe twentieth century lung cancer was a relativelyrare disease and that nearly 90 percent of lungcancer today has been caused by cigarette smoking. In addition to cigarette smoking other forms of tobacco use also cause disease.

Other tobaccoproducts popular throughout the world are alsoharmful and can cause death and disease. Mostnotably kreteks popular in Indonesia and bidis popular in India have been shown to cause can cer heart and lung diseases.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1350,The use of thesenovel tobacco products is beginning to spreadfrom their original location and unfortunately are becoming popular among children particu larly in the United States. Not only does smoking cause disease in the smoker but nonsmokers also are adversely ef fected by exposure to secondhand smoke. In 1986 a report by the U.S.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1351,Surgeon General concludedthat exposure to secondhand smoke causes dis ease including cancer in otherwise healthy adults.In 1992 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agencydocumented the effects of secondhand smoke on respiratory outcomes especially among children and concluded that secondhand smoke was a po tent carcinogen. THE MAGNITUDE OF THE USE OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS In the United States tobacco products have been used for hundreds of years.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1352,Early consumption oftobacco products was predominantly ceremonialuse by Native Americans followed by more wide spread use of tobacco for pipes hand rolled ciga rettes cigars and chewing. Cigarette smoking aswe know it today as a highly addicting and ha bituated behavior is a function of the twentiethcentury.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1353,The introduction of blended tobacco thatallowed for inhalation the invention of the safetymatch the ability to mass produce cigarettes cou pled with sophisticated distribution systems andunprecedented marketing efforts led to the rapidadoption of cigarette smoking during the ﬁrst halfof the twentieth century peaking in the mid 1960s. Annual per capita cigarette consumptionincreased from 54 cigarettes in 1900 to a high of4 345 cigarettes in 1963.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1354,The release of a landmarkreport by the Surgeon General in 1964 whichdetailed the health effects of smoking has led to aseries of social and behavioral changes associatedwith a nearly 50 percent decline in annual percapita consumption to a level of 2 136 ciga rettes in 1999.In addition to the reduction in per capita cigarette consumption the United States has alsoexperienced a reduction in adult smoking preva lence decreasing from about 43 percent in 1965 to24 percent in 1998 meaning there are tens ofmillions of fewer smokers than if earlier rates ofsmoking had continued.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1355,The reduction in theproportion of the adult population who smoke hasnot been as great as the reduction in per capitaconsumption indicating that those who continueto smoke are also smoking fewer cigarettes. While the U.S. reduction in adult smoking rates has been substantial when compared to thelevel of smoking in 1964 there has been relativelylittle progress in the 1990s when adult smokingrates appeared to have plateaued at about 25percent.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1356,In addition the progress that has beenachieved since 1964 has not been experiencedequally by all U.S. population groups. Smokingrates appear to vary by race and ethnicity level ofeducation age poverty status and region of thecountry. Contrary to other parts of the world there is a relatively small difference in smokingrates based on gender.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1357,In 1998 there was a nearlythreefold difference in the likelihood of smokingbased on race and ethnicity with the highest smok ing rates occurring among American Indian andAlaska Native populations 40.0 and the lowestoccurring among Asian and Paciﬁc Islander groups 13.7 .
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1358,A similar differential is seen in relation tolevel of education with high school drop outs atleast three times more likely to smoke than collegegraduates 36.8 vs. 11.3 respectively and thedifference between the two groups appear to beincreasing. Additionally state of residence seemsvery important with the lowest smoking rates inUtah 13.9 and the highest in Nevada 31.5 .Lastly smoking rates vary by age and poverty level but not as greatly as for race and ethnicity educa tional level or state of residence.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1359,For example those sixty ﬁve years of age and older and thosewhose income is at or above the poverty level areless likely to smoke than those under sixty ﬁveyears of age and those living in poverty. The 1994 Surgeon Generals Report Preventing Tobacco Use among Young People focused intense interest on smoking among young people.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1360,This report emphasized the fact that smoking onset and nicotine addiction almost always begin in theteen years and it provided an early warning of an TOBACCO CONTROL 1199increase in the use of tobacco products among young people. In fact after more than a decade ofrelatively stable youth smoking rates in the 1980s cigarette smoking began increasing among highschool students in the early 1990s peaking in 1997.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1361,One of the most interesting observations about youth smoking rates is the difference in likelihoodof smoking between black and white youth. In thelate 1970s there was virtually no difference be tween smoking rates based on race. However overthe subsequent two decades white youth contin ued relatively high smoking rates while smokingrates among black youth plummeted.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1362,Unfortu nately this difference between black and whiteyouth in high school is beginning to erode andthere is no difference in cigarette smoking ratesbetween black and white middle school students. While cigarette smoking rates among young people may have peaked there is a disturbingincrease in the use of alternative or novel tobaccoproducts notably in cigars bidis and kreteks.Because of the harm caused by all tobacco prod ucts it is important to monitor total tobacco con sumption.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1363,When this is done tobacco use ratestypically are in the 30 to 40 percent range for alldemographic subgroups and actually exceeds 50percent for white high school boys. Broadly speaking other developed countries are experiencing changes in smoking rates similarto that observed in the United States. These changescan be characterized by gradual declines in adultsmoking contrasted with increases in the earlyand mid 1990s among young people.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1364,The situa tion in the developing world however is quite different and somewhat difﬁcult to characterize due to less systematic attention to monitoringpatterns of tobacco use over time in a manner thatallows for inter country comparisons.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1365,However itcan be said that global tobacco consumption isincreasing with over one billion smokers but withlarge differences in tobacco use by gender type ofproduct consumed and intensity of tobacco use.For example in many countries in the Far East themajority of men smoke but relatively few womendo. In India relatively few women smoke butsmokeless tobacco use is common. In many coun tries smoking intensity the number of cigarettessmoked per day is much lower than in developedcountries.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1366,However all of these parameters arelikely to change as the multinational tobacco com panies increase marketing and promotion effortsin developing countries. In an effort to systemize and standardize the collection of tobacco data the World Health Organi zation WHO in collaboration with the Centersfor Disease Control and Prevention CDC havedeveloped the Global Youth Tobacco Survey GYTS which is an effort to collect in depth dataon tobacco use patterns and attitudes from adoles cents throughout the world.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1367,By the end of 2001 over seventy countries are expected to have col lected standardized data on tobacco use amongyoung people as part of the GYTS project. Clearly more is needed to standardize the global collec tion of tobacco data not just tobacco use rates butcountry speciﬁc data on the effect of tobacco useon public health the presence of tobacco controllegislation and the cost of cigarettes.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1368,Accordingly the American Cancer Society in collaborationwith WHO and CDC has recently published To bacco Control Country Proﬁles which is a summary of the existing tobacco related data for each coun try of the world. EFFORTS TO REDUCE TOBACCO USE The reduction of cigarette smoking in the United States during the ﬁnal third of the twentieth cen tury has been counted as one of the ten greatestpublic health achievements of the century.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1369,Unfor tunately the achievement is only half completed and the progress that has been achieved in reduc ing tobacco use has come too late for millions ofsmokers. The CDC estimates that since the time ofthe ﬁrst Surgeon General s Report in 1964 10million Americans have died as a result of smok ing.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1370,Additional analysis suggests that if currenttrends continue another 25 million Americansalive today including 5 million children will bekilled by cigarette smoking Thus while progressin the United States and other developed coun tries has been signiﬁcant the past and futurepublic health burden caused by tobacco continuesto be unacceptable.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1371,To accelerate efforts to reduce tobacco use the United States has proposed speciﬁc objectivesfor the year 2010 including the bold objective ofreducing tobacco use by one half to no more than12 percent for all population groups. While this is TOBACCO CONTROL 1200an extremely ambitious objective in the face of demographic trends it is felt that it can be achievedif the nation states and communities simply im plement what is known to work in preventing andreducing tobacco use.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1372,To assist in this effort the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services USDHHS has pre pared a series of publications reviewing the evi dence on the effectiveness of tobacco control in terventions. In 1999 the CDC published Best Practices for Comprehensive Tobacco Control Programsto assist states in the development implementa tion and evaluation of comprehensive tobacco control programs.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1373,Best Practices provides the re search and scientiﬁc evidence in support of nineprogrammatic elements that have been shown tobe effective in reducing tobacco use. In 2000 Reducing Tobacco Use A Report of the Surgeon Gen eral was released. This publication took a broader view of tobacco control reviewing the evidencefor programmatic work and assessing the effec tiveness of economic and regulatory strategies toreduce tobacco use.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1374,Most recently the Task Forceon Community Preventive Services established rulesof evidence to rigorously review the publishedliterature on a variety of tobacco control strate gies including efforts to reduce exposure to envi ronmental tobacco smoke increasing tobacco usecessation and preventing initiation. Additionalreviews will be forthcoming on pricing minors access to tobacco products and media campaigns.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1375,While these several documents were devel oped for slightly different purposes together theyprovide a complete picture of the evidence fortobacco control and the Surgeon General has concluded that if the evidence based interventionsthat already exist were applied the Healthy People 2010 objective of reducing tobacco use in half could be achieved.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1376,If smoking rates are reduced inhalf millions of lives will be saved and the expen diture of billions of dollars on treating diseasescaused by smoking can be averted. Preliminaryevidence from California is already demonstratingthat sustained implementation of effective tobac co control interventions not only reduces smokingrates but can save lives and dollars. There are many important components in successfully reducing tobacco use.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1377,Most practi tioners and scholars recommend comprehensiveapproaches where the different program elementswork in concert to reinforce a speciﬁc tobacco control message. These program componentsshould strive to reduce both the demand and thesupply of tobacco products although a recentreview of the evidence strongly recommends that demand reduction strategies are more effectivethan those attempting to inﬂuence the supply oftobacco products. The most inﬂuential supply sideintervention is control of smuggling.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1378,Many interventions have been found to inﬂu ence reduction in tobacco use e.g. increasing theprice of tobacco products treating nicotine addic tion restricting indoor smoking while othershave been shown to increase the use of tobaccoproducts e.g. tobacco advertising campaignstargeted to young people decreases in the price oftobacco products other actions have little evi dence simply because they have yet to be tried oradequately evaluated e.g.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1379,product regulation plainpackaging limits on tar and nicotine levels . Of the strategies not yet tested regulation of tobacco products may be one of the most impor tant to consider. Tobacco products are currentlysubject to minimal regulation and they are ex pressly exempted from regulation by a number offederal laws designed to protect consumers suchas the Consumer Product Safety Act. Many people consider the Food and Drug Administration FDA the logical U.S. agency toregulate tobacco products.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1380,However up until re cently the FDA had not considered such regula tions. This perspective changed dramatically inFebruary 1994 when FDA commissioner DavidKessler announced his intent to investigate therole of nicotine in tobacco products and whetherthe regulations of these products should comeunder FDA authority.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1381,Following a thorough inves tigation the FDA did determine that nicotine wasa drug that causes addiction and that cigaretteswere medical devices intended to deliver nicotinein a manner to affect the structure and function ofthe body the critical threshold for FDA to assertjurisdiction. During the last half of the 1990s theFDA went forward with its rule making authority asserted jurisdiction over tobacco products withan initial focus on the sale and marketing of to bacco products to young people.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1382,The tobaccoindustry along with advertising groups challengedthe FDA s authority to regulate tobacco with thecase going all the way to the Supreme Court. In TOBACCO CONTROL ADVOCACY AND POLICIES CANADA 1201March 2000 the Supreme Court ruled ﬁve to four against the FDA asserting its jurisdiction overtobacco citing the fact that Congress had notprovided such authority. Part of meaningful product regulation includes restrictions on the promotion and marketing oftobacco products.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1383,The evidence is clear that moneyspent by the tobacco industry to market and pro mote tobacco products contributes to continuedusage by improving the appeal access and af fordability of tobacco products. In 1999 the U.S. cigarette companies reported spending 8.24 bil lion on marketing and promoting cigarettes the most ever spent and a 22 percent increase fromexpenditures in the preceding year.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1384,This amountsto an annual marketing expenditure of approxi mately 165 per smoker or over forty cents forevery pack sold. The magnitude of this expendi ture is presumably in response to the rapid declinein per capita consumption which decreased 10.3percent between 1998 and 1999 following a 4.2percent decline between 1997 and 1998.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1392,Government data indicate that the smoking rate fell from 50percent of adults in 1965 to 25 percent in 1999. In 1964 tobacco manufacturers adopted a voluntary code with modest advertising restric tions later amended to prohibit direct televisionand radio advertising starting in 1978. Effective in1989 the federal Tobacco Products Control Act TPCA included a phased in tobacco advertisingban. In practice however tobacco manufacturersshifted marketing expenditures to sponsorshipadvertising.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1393,Following a tobacco industry constitu tional challenge in 1995 the Supreme Court ofCanada invalidated key parts of the TPCA. Areplacement law the Tobacco Act was adopted in1997. This act contains signiﬁcant advertising re strictions and effective October 1 2003 a totalban on sponsorship advertising. Since 1989 fed eral law has prohibited free distribution of tobaccoproducts and has banned incentive promotions e.g. contests gifts rebates and frequent pur chaser programs .
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1394,Health warnings on cigarette packages ﬁrst appeared in Canada in 1972 with a single volun tary statement placed by manufacturers in smallprint on the package. In 1989 federal legislationrequired one of four rotated warnings to cover 20percent of the package front and back. In 1994 one of eight rotated warnings had to cover aboutthe top 35 percent of the package front and back.The warnings appeared in black and white insteadof in package colors as in previous warnings.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1395,As of2001 sixteen rotated warnings are required cov ering the top 50 percent of the package front andback.

However in 1994 there was a dramatictobacco tax rollback by the federal governmentand ﬁve provinces in response to large scale smug gling. In Ontario and Quebec the retail price ofcigarettes was effectively cut in half adverselyimpacting smoking trends.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1400,Since 1994 the federalgovernment has imposed a proﬁt surtax on to bacco manufacturers. In 1998 British Columbiarequired public disclosure of ingredients by brand aworld ﬁrst and in 1994 the House of CommonsStanding Committee on Health recommended im plementation of plain packaging. Lawsuits to recover tobacco related medicare costs from the tobacco industry were ﬁled by British Columbia 1998 re ﬁled 2000 and Ontario 2000 .
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1401,About ten individual and class action law suits have been ﬁled against the industry since 1988.

Toronto Butterworths. TOBACCO CONTROL ADVOCACY AND POLICIES U.S. At its simplest level advocacy involves writing or speaking in an effort to convince others to takesome type of action.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1404,Tobacco control advocacy isaimed at reducing the harm caused by tobacco useby changing the underlying political economic and social conditions that encourage tobacco use.In this effort groups of citizens or advocates band together to promote policies and practices that protect people from exposure to cigarettesmoke prevent young people from starting to bacco use and create an environment supportiveof quitting smoking.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1405,Typically science politics and activism are combined to generate publicsupport for these goals. Leaders of the highly proﬁtable tobacco in dustry view tobacco control advocacy as a threat totheir business. Tobacco companies have spentbillions of dollars lobbying federal state and locallawmakers to vote against policies promoted bytobacco control advocates.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1406,The industry also con ducts expensive campaigns to convince smokers business owners and the general public to resist adoption of tobacco control policies.Tobacco control advocates often work with far fewer resources than the tobacco industry. Tobaccocontrol advocacy represents a substantial exten sion of earlier public health efforts that focused oneducating smokers directly about quitting and onteaching school children about the dangers ofsmoking.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1407,Advocacy efforts now focus on change atthe community level on improving the environ ment in which people make decisions to use to bacco or not. This often requires public aware ness understanding activation and sometimesoutrage. Ultimately advocacy changes the behav ior of individuals by targeting institutional policiesand practices. Advocates often organize their efforts by join ing forces in local or state coalitions.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1408,They strategi cally use mass media to publicize the changesneeded to protect people from tobacco s harmfuleffects and to expose the tobacco industry s ag gressive marketing and lobbying efforts. Both to bacco control advocates and their opponents tryto shape the debate by framing the issue or mes sage to succinctly illustrate their views e.g. de scribing tobacco use as a pediatric disease or asan individual freedom .
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1409,Tobacco control advocates promote a variety of public and private policies at the federal state and local levels. States and communities vary greatlyin the number and types of laws passed and in howwell they are enforced. The following are exam ples of the major types of policies promoted bytobacco control advocates.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1410,INCREASING PRICE THROUGH TAXATION State and local governments have the authority to increase taxes paid by people who buy tobaccoproducts which increases the price an individualpays for these products. In theory at least themore tobacco costs the less tobacco people use.As of 2000 the federal tax on cigarettes was 24cents per pack. All ﬁfty states also impose cigarettetaxes ranging from 2.5 cents a pack in Virginia toone dollar per pack in Alaska and Hawaii.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1411,Severalstates increased tobacco taxes in the 1980s and1990s. For example California passed a law in1988 increasing the state s cigarette tax by 25 centsper pack and the tax proceeds were mostly used toﬁnance tobacco related education and researchprograms media campaigns and health services. TOBACCO CONTROL ADVOCACY AND POLICIES U.S. 1204RESTRICTING TOBACCO MARKETING Tobacco is one of the most heavily advertised products in the world.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1412,A federal law passed in 1969prohibits tobacco advertising on television andradio and state and local ordinances passed in the1980s and 1990s restricted some forms of tobaccomarketing. Additionally in 1998 the tobacco in dustry agreed to end all outdoor advertising andpromotional giveaways as a part of the MasterSettlement Agreement with state attorneys gen eral in forty six states.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1413,However cigarette advertis ing continues to be prominent in magazines instores that sell tobacco products and throughindustry sponsorship of car races concerts artexhibits and other events. ESTABLISHING SMOKE FREE WORKPLACES AND PUBLIC SPACES Smoke free environments protect nonsmokers from breathing toxic tobacco smoke and helpsmokers reduce or quit smoking.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1414,Since the 1970s thousands of employers have restricted smokingin their work spaces and hundreds of local govern ments have passed ordinances banning tobaccouse in schools restaurants theatres libraries shop ping malls and other public places. RESTRICTING YOUTH ACCESS TO TOBACCO Most tobacco users begin smoking as preteens or teenagers and become addicted during the ﬁrstfew years of tobacco use.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1415,All states have lawsprohibiting tobacco sales to those under 18 yearsof age but these laws are often unenforced mak ing it easy for underage people to get cigarettes.Policies to restrict youth access to tobacco includeincreasing enforcement of laws prohibiting under age tobacco sales banning or limiting access tovending machines posting warning signs where youths attempt to purchase tobacco products and establishing a minimum age for clerks who selltobacco.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1416,The Synar Amendment a federal lawadopted in 1994 encourages states to enforceyouth access laws by threatening to reduce federalfunding for mental health programs to any statethat does not demonstrate effective enforcement.Increasingly lawsuits are being brought against tobacco companies to hold them accountable fortheir actions.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1417,This is an effective strategy that wasbolstered in the 1990s by the increased availabil ity of internal tobacco industry documents re vealing a long standing practice of targeting un derage users and potential users. Although to bacco control advocacy started with small groupsat the community level it has developed into asubdiscipline within public health and many or ganizations made tobacco control a priority.

TOBACCO CONTROL ADVOCACY AND POLICIES IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES 1205TOBACCO CONTROL ADVOCACY AND POLICIES INDEVELOPING COUNTRIES There were approximately 1.1 billion smokers in the world in 2000 a ﬁgure predicted to exceed 1.6billion by the year 2025. Smoking causes one in tendeaths globally and by 2030 it will be closer to onein six. By 2020 it is predicted that 70 percent ofpeople who die from smoking related causes willlive in developing countries.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1422,In addition the age atwhich people ﬁrst try smoking in developing coun tries is decreasing. Between 82 000 and 99 000young people start smoking every day over 80percent of whom live in developing countries. While many developing countries have low ratesof smoking among females these rates are also onthe rise. Aggressive marketing by the tobacco in dustry has fueled this trend.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1423,During the last two decades of the twentieth century governments responded to the smokingepidemic with diverse tobacco control TC poli cies. These measures have faced many domesticand global challenges including a lack of fundsand competition with other pressing problems.Serious challenges to TC policies also come fromtransnational tobacco companies TTCs .
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1424,ELEMENTS OF TOBACCO CONTROL POLICIES Tobacco control policies may address both the supply and demand side of the tobacco equation.Supply side controls include limiting tobacco salesand imports as well as policies to support alterna tive crops or livelihoods.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1425,Demand side controlsinclude taxation bans partial or total on advertis ing and other forms of tobacco marketing restric tions on where people smoke prohibiting tobaccosale to minors health warnings restrictions on theingredients in tobacco products and the provisionof accessible nicotine replacement therapies. Poli cies vary considerably across nations. Many demand side measures aim to reduce smoking prevalence and discourage young peoplefrom starting. Taxation has been shown to be an effective tool.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1426,Between 1979 and 1991 there wasan inverse relationship between the real tobaccoprice index and teen smoking in Canada. In South Africa cigarette taxes are now 47 percent of theprice of a package. Such policies however facesevere opposition from the tobacco industry. Mex ico for example reduced taxes on cigarettes in thelate 1980s under pressure from tobacco companies. Banning tobacco advertising is another policy tool.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1427,China has laws that ban tobacco advertisingin the print media and on radio and television aswell as advertising directed at adolescents thoughthese laws are unevenly enforced. South Africaalso bans direct advertising of cigarettes on televi sion and recently banned tobacco sponsorshipsfor sporting and cultural events. Other countrieslag behind. In Senegal advertising through spon sorships of sporting and cultural events is com mon.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1428,Under Mexico s partial ban companies arediscouraged from associating smoking with civic religious or sports activities and are not allowedto use models younger than twenty ﬁve years old.Tobacco advertising is permitted on television inthe evening however. Policies to control environmental tobacco smoke ETS are also becoming more common indeveloping countries.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1429,Doctors nurses and teach ers smoke in the workplace in Senegal and inMexico few restrictions exist on smoking in publicplaces other than in poorly ventilated public build ings. In South Africa however smoking is re stricted in government buildings airports andrestaurants. Enforcement of clean air policies andassociated penalties is often minimal.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1430,In China smoking is restricted in most public places onpublic transportation and on domestic airlineﬂights but the ﬁne for infractions is less than thecost of a package of imported cigarettes. Warning labels on cigarette packages tend to be worded much less strongly in developing coun tries. Statements such as This product may beharmful to your health or Smoking is hazardousto your health are used.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1431,This is in stark contrast toCanada s use of graphic images of the impact ofsmoking on health introduced in January 2001. Despite successes country speciﬁc compre hensive TC policies are still uncommon and theirineffective implementation is alarming. In coun tries such as Senegal and China TC policies of the1980s and 1990s have become progressively weakerdue to poor enforcement.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1432,TOBACCO CONTROL ADVOCACY AND POLICIES IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES 1206CHALLENGES AND A ROLE FOR CIVIL SOCIETY Limited funding and large disparities in the will ingness of the public and policy makers to developand enforce policies pose a challenge to the suc cess of TC policies.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1433,Barriers also include low liter acy rates multiple languages within a country andhigh rates of smoking among health professionals especially doctors who exert a signiﬁcant inﬂu ence over communities attitudes and behaviors.The heavy dependence of some economies ontobacco is also a threat. In Malawi and Zimbabwe governments fear that a decrease in tobacco con sumption would eventually lead to higher unem ployment and lower foreign capital.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1434,Many chal lenges are easier to overcome where strong politicalsupport popular support and relevant researchﬁndings exist as South Africa has proven. Effec tive advocacy organizations also contribute to thedevelopment of TC policies. Advocacy groups are sometimes invited to participate in the development of TC policies.Unfortunately civil society in developing coun tries may be weak or focused on other pressingissues such as democracy the environment orprimary health care.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1435,Nevertheless organizationssuch as ASH Thailand Action on Smoking andHealth have played an active role in the develop ment and implementation of TC policies and servesas models for others. Unfortunately tobacco com panies encourage groups to lobby governmentsagainst new TC policies for lenient legislation orfor free trade in tobacco.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1436,For instance in the 1980s American based TTCs began to pressure Asian countries to opentheir markets through a group called the UnitedStates Cigarette Exporting Association USCEA .In 1985 despite a tobacco import ban USCEAbegan advertising in Thailand. The following year the Thai Anti Smoking Campaign Project startedto pressure the government until in 1989 alltobacco advertising was banned.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1437,When negotia tions between USCEA and the Thai governmentbroke down later that year the association askedthe U.S. trade representative to use the U.S. TradeAct to pressure the Thai government to open thecigarette market prompting a strong reaction fromThai and international anti smoking groups andadvocates.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1438,Finally in 1990 the General Agree ment on Trade and Tariffs GATT the forerunnerof the WTO ruled that Thailand could not con tinue to ban imports of cigarettes but that it couldcontinue to enforce its ban on tobacco advertisingprovided the law was applied equally to domesticand foreign products. Thailand s partial success inﬁghting American based tobacco companies is in dicative of the difﬁculties in ﬁghting TTCs de structive use of its power.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1439,TOBACCO CONTROL POLICIES IN A GLOBAL CONTEXT Globalization comprises two general trends. The ﬁrst is economic globalization by way of globaltrade liberalization. The second trend is toward atransnational sharing of cultural political andsocial values which has been factored by elec tronic communications and the media. Both trends present distinct challenges and opportunities to effective TC policies.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1440,Economic globalization reduces trade barri ers between countries including tariffs subsidies and import restrictions. Tobacco control research ers advocates and health ofﬁcials are concernedthat these agreements open the door to TTCs toﬂood the markets of developing countries withtheir cigarettes and thus hinder a nation s abil ity to control tobacco use. Using homogenizingcultural images TTCs also exploit social andcultural globalization in their marketing e.g.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1441,Phil ip Morris s Marlboro man and ads focused onwomen suggesting that smoking is modern andemancipated . Given political commitment and organized efforts it is possible to successfully ﬁght the effortsof the tobacco companies. The effectiveness ofcross national coalitions of advocacy and research groups will continue to be crucial e.g. the Inter national Non Governmental Coalition AgainstTobacco GLOBALink as will the efforts of or ganizations such as the United Nations.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1442,INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND TOBACCO CONTROL POLICIES The World Bank no longer lends money to coun tries for tobacco related projects and has recentlylaid out its approach to tobacco control whichfocuses on demand side strategies including taxa tion non price measures and cessation therapies. TOBACCO SALES TO YOUTH REGULATION OF 1207In 1998 the WHO created the Tobacco Free Initiative TFI which aims to reduce smokingprevalence and tobacco consumption globally.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1443,TFIis also developing the Framework Convention forTobacco Control FCTC which if signed by allWHO member countries will provide a legal in strument as the basis of global and national TCpolicies in the face of transnational threats. Sched uled to be completed by May 2003 the FCTC willenable effective regional and global cooperationregarding TC concerns such as smuggling andadvertising.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1444,The health economic productivity and qual ity of life of the citizens in developing countries isunder threat by increased tobacco consumption.Yet despite many efforts research policy andenforcement remain inadequate. Future successwill largely depend on a strong research base tosupport policy development as well as effective advocacy and coalition building to bridge the gapbetween research and policy.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1452,D OVELL SEE ALSO Enabling Factors Tobacco Control TOTAL SUSPENDED PARTICLES TSP Total suspended particles TSP is an archaic regu latory measure of the mass concentration of par ticulate matter PM in community air. It wasdeﬁned by the unintended size selectivity of theinlet to the ﬁlter that collected the particles. Unfortu nately the size cut varied with wind speed anddirection and was from 20 to 50 µm microns inaerodynamic diameter.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1453,Under windy conditionsthe mass tended to be dominated by large wind blown soil particles of relatively low toxicity. In 1987 the EPA revised the National Ambi ent Air Quality Standard NAAQS for PM and changed the PM pollution index to PM10 an index of the PM that can enter the thorax andcause or exacerbate lower respiratory tract dis eases such as chronic bronchitis asthma pneu monia lung cancer and emphysema.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1454,This switchto a more health related index stimulated studiesof the associations between ambient air PM andmortality morbidity and cardiopulmonary func tion indices. Some of the studies also used meas ures of the ﬁne PM concentrations in the air asindexed by PM2.5 and or sulfate and were ableto show that annual mortality rates were moreclosely associated with ﬁne particles than with thelarger PM10.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1455,In 1997 in its next revision of the PM NAAQS the EPA supplemented its regulations on PM10with new regulations on PM2.5. The cut points arenot perfectly sharp for any of these PM size indica tors some particles larger than the cut point arecollected and some particles smaller than the cutpoint are not retained. The terms ﬁne and coarse were originally intended to apply to the two major atmosphericparticle distributions which overlap in the sizerange between 1 and 3 microns.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1456,Now ﬁne has been deﬁned by EPA as PM2.5 and coarse asPM10 2.5. However PM2.5 may contain in addi tion to the ﬁne particle mode some of the smallersized coarse particles. Conversely under highrelative humidity conditions the larger particles inthe accumulation mode extend into the 1 to 3micron range. The chemical complexity of airborne particles requires that the composition and sources of alarge number of primary and secondary compo nents be considered.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1457,Major components of ﬁneparticles are SO4 H NO3 NH4 organiccompounds trace elements including metals thatvolatize at combustion temperatures elementalcarbon and water. Major sources of these ﬁnemode substances are fossil fuel combustion byelectric utilities industry and motor vehicles vege tation burning and the smelting or other process ing of metals.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1461,TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL ACT During the early part of the twentieth century there was a tremendous increase in the develop ment of new synthetic chemicals as well as a rise inindustrial uses for older ones. By 1976 it wasestimated that there were 60 000 chemical sub stances in commercial use in the United States. Aneed was identiﬁed for a comprehensive frame work for the prevention of risks that might beposed by these chemicals.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1462,In response to this need Congress enacted the Toxic Substances ControlAct TSCA in 1976 see Figure 1 . The TSCAaddressed three major policy goals Those who manufacture and process chemical substances and mixtures shoulddevelop adequate data with respect to theeffect of chemical substances and mix tures on health and the environment.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1463,The government should have adequate authority to regulate chemical substancesand mixtures that present an unreason able risk of injury to health or theenvironment and to take action withrespect to chemical substances and mix tures that are imminent hazards.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1464,Government s authority over chemical sub stances and mixtures should be exercised in such a manner as not to im pede unduly or create unnecessary eco nomic barriers to technological innova tion while assuring that such substancesand mixtures do not present an unrea sonable risk of injury to health or theenvironment. Further Congress made clear its intent that the government shall consider the environmen tal economic and social impact of any action theadministrator takes or proposes to take.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1465,In addition to general provisions related to chemicals and substances the TSCA containedspeciﬁc requirements to regulate polychlorinatedbiphenyls PCBs . Over the years TSCA wasamended to speciﬁcally regulate asbestos 1986 Radon 1988 and lead 1992 . The TSCA contains a number of major provi sions that provide the EPA with tools for assess ment and control of chemicals used in commerce or proposed to be added to commerce.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1466,TSCAauthorized a number of activities under the EPAAdministration including the authority to issuechemical test rules section 4 a requirement for aPremanufactive Notiﬁcation PNM to be ﬁled atleast 90 days prior to manufacture or processing ofa new chemical section 5 authority to regulatechemical risks section 6 a requirement to reportchemical data and information on adverse healthand environmental effects section 8 require ments related to export and import of chemicals sections 12 13 and protection by EPA of conﬁ dential business information section 14 .
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1467,Theseprovisions broadly direct the EPA to assure thatthe public will be protected from unreasonablerisks to health and the environment.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1468,Althoughthe statute did not clearly deﬁne unreasonablerisk since its enactment through administrativeand judicial actions this has come to be inter preted as including aspects of both risk analysis which analyzes the severity and magnitude of healthand environmental effects and economic analysis which looks at the economic beneﬁts of the use ofthe substance as well as the availability and costs ofswitching to alternatives.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1469,In the cases of PCBs asbestos radon and lead Congress saw ﬁt toidentify that unreasonable risks did indeed exist and gave the EPA very speciﬁc direction for how toaddress those risks. Several aspects of TSCA s chemical regulatory regime have been studied extensively by theNational Academy of Sciences the CongressionalOfﬁce of Technology Assessment the GeneralAccounting Ofﬁce and the EPA itself. Generally the regulation of existing chemi cals under TSCA has been modest.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1470,The Gen eral Accounting Ofﬁce concluded in 1994 thatthe EPA regulates few chemicals under TSCAsection 6 listing only ﬁve polychlorinatedbiphenyls chloroﬂuorocarbons dioxin asbestos and hexavalent chromium and noting that the TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL ACT 1210Figure 1 Toxic Substances Control Act Title Section Title I 4 5 6 6 e 8 9 12 13 14Title II Title III Title IVPurpose Control of Toxic Substances Chemical testing New chemical notices Regulation of hazardous chemical substances and mixtures Regulation of polychlorinated biphenyls Industry reporting of chemical data TSCA s relationship to other laws Chemical export and import provisions Disclosure of chemical data Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Indoor Radon Abatement Lead Exposure ReductionActivities Test rules must show that the chemical may present an unreasonable risk or that substantial exposure may exist.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1471,Premanufacture Notification PMN must be filed at least 90 days prior to manufacture or processing of a new chemical. No test data are required at this stage. If the chemical will pose an unreasonable risk EPA must act. If it may pose an unreasonable risk EPA can impose temporary controls or restrictions until data are developed. EPA can take action against chemicals that pose an unreasonable risk to health or the environment.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1472,Actions includebanning or restricting production processing distribution use and requiring warning labels. Phased out the manufacture and certain uses of PCBs as well as PCB import and export. Directs manufacturers and processors to maintain records and provide data to the EPA as required. Such data can include chemical identity categories of use production levels by products existing data on adverse health and environmental effects and the number of workers exposed.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1482,Forexample a pedestrian injured by a careless driver may ﬁle a tort action lawsuit to recover com pensation from the driver. A toxic tort is one in which the wrongful act consists of exposure to atoxic substance. This could occur in a variety ofways such as an accidental release e.g. a chemicalspill or explosion workplace exposure e.g. tosolvent fumes or asbestos or harmful effectsfrom medications or other consumer products.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1483,Tort compensation or damages may be re covered for a variety of losses including medicalexpenses lost earnings and pain and suffering. By shifting these costs from the victim to the wrong doer the tort system seeks to accomplish certainpolicy goals including deterrence of harmful con duct and where relevant the promotion of publichealth and safety. The injury in a toxic tort case may be acute immediate fatal poisoning or burns to the skinare acute injuries.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1484,Classically however the injuryinvolved in toxic tort litigation is a serious latentdisease such as cancer or birth defects that maynot develop until many years after the toxic expo sure. In cases involving latent disease there isvirtually always a dispute over causation. The plain tiff has the difﬁcult burden of proving that thedisease resulted from the particular exposure whichmay have occurred ten or twenty years earlier rather than from some other cause e.g.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1485,geneticinheritance smoking lack of exercise diet someother toxic exposure or simply from unknowncauses . Asbestos is one exception where medical sci ence can positively trace the substance that caused a patient s cancer or other serious disease. As aresult huge tort recoveries have virtually closeddown asbestos manufacturing in this country. The potential for toxic tort liability can affect new products as well.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1486,A manufacturer may decideagainst the development and marketing of a dan gerous product if tests show that the risk of injury and therefore of tort liability is too high. Some times however the specter of toxic tort litigationdeters the manufacture of beneﬁcial products such as vaccines and other pharmaceuticals. In the1980s and 1990s numerous toxic tort suits allegedthat the controversial drug Bendectin prescribedfor morning sickness during pregnancy causedbirth defects.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1487,Scientiﬁc evidence presented by themanufacturer persuaded the courts that Bendectin TOXICOLOGY 1212does not cause birth defects. Nevertheless the manufacturer stopped producing Bendectin re portedly due to the high cost of defending itself inrepetitious litigation. Courts can grant a variety of remedies in toxic tort cases that can beneﬁt public health.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1489,Toxic tort lawsuits are sometimes initiated soon after a toxic exposure especially a massexposure even though the plaintiffs have no physi cal symptoms of disease. Plaintiffs have argued without much success that they should receivepresent compensation because the exposure in creases their risk of developing cancer in the fu ture and also for the emotional distress caused bytheir fear of future cancer.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1490,Courts have been morereceptive to the argument that exposure victimsshould be compensated for the expense of peri odic medical monitoring.

Santa Monica CA Rand Corporation. TOXICOLOGY Toxicology is the science of poisons. Understand ing the potential for toxicity of agents found innature has been a necessity for human survival. Learning to use natural toxins for purposes suchas hunting and warfare was as much a part ofhuman adaptation of the environment as was thetaming of ﬁre.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1492,One of the ﬁrst known examples ofthe unwanted toxicity of a manufactured productwas the lead poisoning that occurred in Romantimes as a result of lead plumbing and lead dish ware. Today the emphasis of toxicology is ondetecting and preventing the unwanted effects of chemical and physical agents although concerns about the intentional misuse of chemicals includ ing chemical warfare will persist for the foresee able future. As a science toxicology is at the interface between chemistry and biology.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1493,There are three laws of toxicology. The oldest that the dosemakes the poison is attributed to Paracelsus aﬁfteenth century German physician. The conceptthat all chemical agents are toxic at some dose iscentral to a respect for the inherent hazard of allchemicals.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1494,The second law of toxicology thatthe biologic actions of chemicals are speciﬁc toeach chemical has been attributed to AmbroiseParé a sixteenth century French surgeon who rec ognized that toxic agents have different effectsdependent upon their inherent nature. Under standing the speciﬁc action of chemicals known as hazard identiﬁcation depends upon recognizingthe structural determinants of the activity of chemi cals and the biological niches in which chemicalsinteract.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1495,Very subtle changes in chemical structurecan make an enormous difference in biologicaleffects. The third law is that humans are animals.Protection against the toxicity of chemicals todaywould be impossible without the ability to studythe effects of toxic agents in laboratory animals. Asa corollary animal rights activists advocating a banon all animal research present a major threat toenvironmental protection and public health. Toxicologists generally consider two types of dose response relationships.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1496,One has a thresholdbelow which no effect is expected. For example one drop of fuming sulfuric acid will burn a hole inskin yet this same drop in a bathtub full of waterdilutes the sulfuric acid to a level at which noeffects will occur. This theoretical threshold ex perimentally known as a no observed effect level is presumed to exist for all agents except for thosethat produce their effects through mutation most TOXICOLOGY 1213notably many cancer causing agents.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1497,A mutation can theoretically occur through a single chemicalmolecule producing a speciﬁc change in the chemi cal structure of a DNA molecule thereby alteringthe genetic code from that of a normal cell to thatof a mutated cell. As a further simpliﬁcation twomolecules have twice as much chance as causing this effect. This can be described as a linear one hitrelationship between the dose of a mutational agent and the likelihood that the mutation willoccur.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1498,The theoretical risk for any one moleculecausing a mutation is inﬁnitely small there areabout 1 trillion molecules of benzene a knowncause of leukemia in every breath taken in anaverage American city yet very few people de velop leukemia. There are also many defense mecha nisms within cells as well as DNA repair mecha nisms that can impact on the likelihood of chemicalexposures causing cancer. Extrapolation of data from laboratory animals to humans and from high to low doses is centralto modern toxicology.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1499,In addition to understand ing dose response relationships knowledge aboutdifferences among species in the uptake metabo lism and disposition of chemicals is also of impor tance. There is a strong similarity among mamma lian species. Where differences do exist attentionto the kinetics of the processes that determine howan external exposure level is translated to the doseof a chemical at a target organ provides informa tion of value to cross species extrapolation.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1500,A major challenge in modern toxicology is to prevent unwanted effects of otherwise valu able chemicals including therapeutic agents. Under standing chemical mutagenesis and carcinogenesishas permitted the development of bacterialmutagenesis assays such as the Ames test.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1501,Theseand other short term assays for toxic effects areroutinely used during the development phase ofnew chemicals to screen out potential toxic agents.Before marketing additional testing is often re quired depending in part on the use of the chemi cal. For new pharmaceutical agents extensivetoxicity and efﬁcacy data are required includingstudies in humans. Such agents are expected atanticipated human dose levels to have a biologicaleffect of beneﬁt to the consumer.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1502,In contrast thedevelopers of consumer chemicals such as a newpaint hope that no biological effects will occur atusual doses to humans.There are intermediate agents such as insecti cides and herbicides for which a biological effectis intended at usual doses for these agents pro tection of humans depends in large part on ourdifferent biology.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1503,Accordingly premarket testingis usually less rigorous for consumer chemicalsthan for therapeutic agents and there is moredependence on structure activity relationships SAR . SAR in essence is a comparative analysisof aspects of chemical structure in relation tothe existing toxicological database a useful butnot completely effective approach.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1504,In the UnitedStates the Toxic Substances Control Act requirespremanufacturing notiﬁcation of new chemicalsto the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency whichhas the option of asking for additional testing.Such tests might include a battery of shorter termand longer term tests for acute and chronic dis eases including cancer. The recognition of thedangers inherent in compounds that bioaccumulateor otherwise persist in the environment has led totests to identify and exclude such compoundsfrom commerce.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1505,Long term animal assays usually two year stud ies in male and female rats and mice are themainstay of thorough safety assessment of chemi cals particularly those for which there is a concernabout cancer or other chronic effects. The basicapproach is to ﬁrst perform a multiple dose nine ty day study to choose the maximum tolerateddose MTD . This dose is then used for a two year study.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1506,Sole reliance on standard safety assessment approaches carries a small but ﬁnite risk of missinga potentially toxic agent a risk which is lessened ifstudies assessing the mechanism of toxicity of thechemical are also performed. A major goal oftoxicological research is a better understanding ofthe processes by which chemical agents produceadverse biological effects which will lead to thedevelopment of better safety assessment tests.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1507,The pathways of chemicals into and through the body are usually considered under the head ings of absorption distribution metabolism andexcretion. Absorption the process by which anexternal dose is converted to an internal dose occurs by ingestion inhalation or through theskin.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1508,Distribution of a chemical depends in part onthe pathway of entry and on speciﬁc chemical andbiological factors for example only certain types TOXICOLOGY 1214of chemicals are able to penetrate the blood brain barrier and enter the central nervous system. Much emphasis has been placed on under standing chemical metabolism as this is centralboth to the impact and to the detoxiﬁcation ofchemicals.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1509,The activity of many of the metabolicenzymes can vary greatly among individuals due togenetic and environmental factors including typesof food. Further metabolic rates may vary within agiven individual at different times due to induc tion of metabolic enzymes by these same environ mental factors.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1510,Studies of resistance to cancerchemotherapeutic agents have led to an under standing of mechanisms by which toxic agents canbe rapidly transported out of an otherwise suscep tible cell including speciﬁc transporter proteins which can also be induced in response to environ mental factors. The major metabolic organ is the liver but all organs have some level of metabolic enzymes.Certain chemicals such as benzene are harmlessuntil they are metabolized by the body to formtoxic chemical intermediates.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1511,Further not all chemi cals are metabolized some pass through the bodyunchanged while others react directly with bio logical targets. Major excretory pathways are through urina tion defecation and exhalation. Lactation is also ameans of excretion particularly of fat soluble chemi cals to the potential detriment of the infant.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1512,Differential sensitivity to chemicals is an im portant subject to toxicologists for which modernmolecular biology is providing new insights par ticularly through the understanding of the humangenome.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1513,For most human disease genetics willdetermine what is necessary but the environment deﬁned broadly will determine what is sufﬁcient.A reasonable estimate is that over two thirds ofhuman disease is environmentally determined.Many of the genetic and environmental factorsresponsible for disease operate at the level ofmodifying the absorption distribution metabo lism or excretion of exogenous chemicals includ ing food constituents.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1514,Susceptibility to toxic agents is also conferred by factors such as age gender and concomitantconditions. Children the elderly and those withpreexisting disease tend to be more susceptible to environmental toxins than are healthy adults. Forexample the greater respiratory ventilation perunit of body mass in children accounts for thetragic ﬁnding of death due to carbon monoxidepoisoning in the children but not the adults in asnowbound car.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1515,So called safety factors have traditionally been used in establishing public health and regulatoryguidelines and standards based on toxicologicaldata. These are based on no observed effect levelsin animals which are then reduced by a factor often to provide assurance that the animal data isprotective of humans. In general a tenfold factoris used to account for the possibility that humansare more sensitive than the animal species fromwhich the data are obtained.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1516,Another tenfold fac tor is based on the greater diversity in susceptibil ity factors among humans than in inbred labora tory animals. The resultant hundredfold safetylevel has been used on a relatively routine basis forestablishing acceptable daily intake ADI levels bythe Food and Drug Administration as well as forother regulatory standards. Additional factors often can be added based upon the toxic endpointinvolved or in order to protect children.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1517,Con versely when there is a sufﬁciently robust data base on humans such as for certain air pollutants routine factors of ten are not used and scientiﬁcjudgment contributes to the determination of anappropriate margin of safety. The effect of toxic agents on ecosystems has become increasingly recognized as being impor tant to human health.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1518,Traditionally ecotoxicology in relation to human health has focused on con tamination of the food chain including thebiomagniﬁcation and bioaccumulation of toxicagents within foods.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1519,The recognition of the role ofecosystems in overall planetary health includingfeedback loops affecting climate desertiﬁcation and crop yield as well as the importance of thenatural world and its animal and plant compo nents to human well being has led to additionalemphasis on understanding the toxicity of chemi cal and physical agents to components of nature.

TOXOPLASMOSIS Toxoplasmosis is an infection caused by a single celled protozoan parasite named Toxoplasma gondii found throughout the world in humans mam mals and birds.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1522,Cats the deﬁnitive host for T. gondii usually become infected by eating infected prey and are the only animal that sheds the organ ism as oocysts in their feces. Animals other thancats are usually infected by ingesting oocysts in thesoil or by eating infected animals.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1523,Humans can become infected with T. gondii by one of three main routes 1 by eating raw orinadequately cooked meat that contains T. gondii cysts bradyzoites or by eating uncooked foodsthat have come in contact with infected meat via for example cutting boards or cooking utensils 2 by inadvertently ingesting oocysts that catshave passed in their feces either from a cat litterbox or from soil for example from gardening orby eating unwashed fruits and vegetables 3 anewly infected woman can transmit the infectionto her fetus.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1524,Toxoplasmosis in adults usually does not cause symptoms or causes only mild nonspeciﬁc symp toms such as fever and swelling of the lymphglands. Therefore the diagnosis is usually made bytesting for antibodies that are produced in reac tion to T. gondii infection. However serious illnesscan occur when a newly infected woman passes the infection to her unborn fetus. Such an infectioncan lead to an infant with mental retardation blindness or other neurologic disorders.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1525,An esti mated 400 to 4 000 congenital infections with T. gondii occur in the United States each year. Serious illnesses including infection of the brain can alsooccur in persons who have either old latent or new T. gondii infections when they do not have normal immune system function. Such per sons include those with human immunodeﬁciencyvirus HIV infection or congenital immune ill nesses persons taking drugs that decrease im mune system function and persons with sometypes of cancer.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1526,Effective means of preventing toxoplasmosis are as follows 1 cook meat fully internal tem perature of 160 F before eating it 2 peel orwash fruits and vegetables before eating them 3 wash hands kitchen tools counters and sinks withsoap and water after they have touched raw meator unwashed fruits or vegetables 4 clean the catlitter box every day so T. gondii oocysts do not have time to become infectious one to ﬁve days 5 wear gloves and wash hands after changing catlitter pregnant women should not change catlitter if at all possible 6 keep cats indoors so theydo not become infected by eating prey 7 feedcats only commercially prepared cat food neverundercooked or raw meat and 8 wear gloveswhen gardening and wash hands after contact withsoil and sand with which cats may have had contact.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1529,TRACHOMA Trachoma is a virulent form of conjunctivitis caused by Chlamydia trachomatis a bacterial organism trans mitted by ﬂies that crawl into the eyes of smallchildren. Direct transmission of the organism fromﬁngers damp towels and other objects also oc curs. Characteristically reinfection is frequent inendemic regions this leads to severe scarring andcontractures especially of the upper eyelid andalso causes blood vessels to invade the cornea rendering it opaque.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1530,These effects of recurrentinfection make trachoma a leading cause of blind ness in those parts of the world where the condi tion is prevalent. These are predominantly poor rural areas in hot dry countries such as somenations in the Middle East and in arid regions ofNorth Africa India Pakistan and inland Australia. Trachoma is responsible for about 6 million out of a total of 20 million cases of blindnessworldwide and it causes impaired vision in about140 million people.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1531,Determined efforts have greatlyreduced the incidence of new cases in the last twodecades of the twentieth century however. It israre in industrially developed nations with goodhygiene and effective ﬂy control measures suchas screened windows. Trachoma is an exclusivelyhuman infection so if vulnerable populations canbe protected from exposure e.g. if ﬂies can bereduced or eliminated transmission will ceaseand the infection can be prevented.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1532,These tacticshave worked well in many regions including amongAustralian Aborigines where the prevalence wasvery high until control programs were established. Control was achieved in Australia by an ag gressive campaign led by Dr. Ida Mann who de voted her life to this cause. Her methods com prised topical application of antiseptic and antibioticeyedrops disinfection and face washing educa tion about personal hygiene and ﬂy control pro grams.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1533,Initially this was a mass campaign and itwas reduced to individual case management as endemic conjunctivitis was brought under con trol. The same tactics have worked in the MiddleEast e.g. among nomadic Bedouin populationsin Saudi Arabia and they are working well inendemic regions of India and Pakistan. The WorldHealth Organization with strong support fromseveral foundations and nongovernmental organi zations devoted to prevention of blindness aspiresto eliminate trachoma by 2020.

Career options for a person withan M.P.H. are varied and there are many types oforganizations that employ public health profes sionals.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1551,Historically these have included mainlyfederal state and local health departments butcontemporary public health practice has broad ened to include many other employment settings such as community based organizations healthcare facilities insurance agencies foundations voluntary health agencies and various businessand industry settings.

Public health as a recognized profession emerged in the early and mid 1800s with the onsetof the Industrial Revolution.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1561,In response to thedebilitating social and environmental conditionsassociated with the Industrial Revolution public health emerged as a ﬁeld of practice devoted toreducing disease and maintaining the health of the population. Drawing on the talents of physicians nurses engineers chemists lawyers and statisti cians early public health efforts sought to solvecommunity health problems.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1562,With the break through of bacteriology in the late 1800s publichealth became a science based ﬁeld and the needfor formal training was ﬁrmly established.

The Welch Rose Report of 1915 writ ten by two participants at that conference wouldbecome the major reference document for the early design of schools of public health.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1565,Formally organized and independent schools of public health emerged in this nation shortlyafterwards largely modeled after the Johns Hop kins University School of Hygiene and PublicHealth which was the ﬁrst of several schools ofpublic health to be endowed by the RockefellerFoundation. In the 1920s Johns Hopkins Yale Columbia and Harvard all established schools ofpublic health.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1566,In the following decade the Univer sities of Michigan Minnesota North Carolina and California at Berkeley established full ﬂedgedschools. However a variety of other public healthtraining programs emerged in other institutionsof higher education where offerings included shortintensive courses certiﬁcates diplomas or multi year degree programs.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1567,At about this same time the American Public Health Association then and now the major pro fessional public health organization in the UnitedStates launched a series of activities intended tostandardize the formal training that was neededfor public health practice. In 1946 the APHAestablished a formal accreditation process to pub licly recognize those universities that met thesestandards.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1568,This action responded in part to theurgings of the Association of Schools of PublicHealth a new organization established by the lead ing schools of public health and in part to recom mendations of the U.S. Surgeon General.

Between1986 and 2000 more than 170 000 cases of BSEwere identiﬁed in cattle in the United Kingdom.The epidemic peaked in 1992 1993 at almost1 000 cases per week.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1586,The cause of BSE in British cattle was prob ably the use of commercial cattle feed containingmeat and bone meal MBM derived from therendered carcasses of sheep infected with scrapie a degenerative disease of sheep. MBM is manufac tured by rendering melting out the fat and thendrying the protein portion of by products from themeat processing industry. Using MBM as a proteinsource in animal feed has been common for sev eral decades.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1587,Apparently the pre 1970 renderingmethods which included fat removal with solventsfollowed by a steam treatment eliminated theinfective agent in the rendered material before itwas used in cattle feed. A change to low tempera ture rendering in the 1970s may have allowed theinfective agent to remain in the protein portionthat was dried and used as animal feed. Natural transmission of BSE in cattle occurs when they eat infective material.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1588,The required oraldose for BSE transmission is small ﬁve hundredto one thousand milligrams of BSE infected braintissue for calves. The BSE agent has been foundonly in the brain spinal cord retina and the smallintestines of cattle. BSE and scrapie are transmissible spongiform encephalopathies or TSEs. TSEs appear to becaused by an unconventional infectious agentknown as a prion proteinaceous infectious par ticle an agent that contains no DNA or RNA.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1589,Aprion is a normal protein PrP present on or innerve cell membranes that can assume an abnor mal infective physical shape referred to as PrP sc. One PrPsc molecule can induce normal PrP mole cules to change shape into PrPsc. Mutations in the PrP gene may make the conversion of normal PrP to disease causing PrPsc more likely. There are at least twenty mutations inthe PrP gene sequence resulting in spontaneous PrP sc formation.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1590,Once a few PrPsc molecules are formed they rapidly convert other normal mole cules to the infective form. Ingested PrP sc can travel to the central nervous system where it con verts normal PrP to PrP sc. The nerve cell attempts to break down the prion however PrPsc is very resistant to the en zymes that normally break proteins down. The cellcan be cleaved into fragments which ﬁll up andkill the cell leaving holes known as spongiform damage .
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1591,These fragments aggregate and precipi tate the formation of plaques. Creutzfeldt Jakob disease CJD is a human TSE that occurs primarily in those over sixty ﬁveyears of age. It produces rapidly progressing neu rological symptoms and dementia. In 1995 a newform of CJD variant or new variant CJD vCJD was recognized. Patients have behavioral and psy chiatric disturbances e.g. depression personalitychange failure of muscular coordination andmemory impairment.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1592,The original ten cases oc curred in people under forty two years of age andwere fatal within thirteen months. The hypothe sized cause was consumption of BSE infected foodmaterials. As of March 2001 ninety ﬁve cases ofvCJD had been identiﬁed in the United Kingdom with a few isolated cases occurring in France andIreland. TSEs occur more often in speciﬁc subgroups of populations certain breeds of sheep cattle mink and human families suggesting a geneticcomponent.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1593,Some gene combinations are veryresistant while some are particularly susceptibleto the disease. In addition a TSE in a speciﬁcspecies can exist in several strains with each pro ducing speciﬁc symptoms times of onset and pro gression and lesions in the brain that are distinctly TRAVEL HEALTH PRECAUTIONS 1223different from those produced by other strains. Recent evidence indicates that the TSE strain oc curring in vCJD is not different from the strainresponsible for BSE in cattle.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1594,If the TSE strain thatcauses BSE also causes vCJD the question arises ofwhether there is likely to be an epidemic of vCJD. The chances of such an epidemic are reduced by the fact that the incubation period for CJD isrelatively long in humans and because much ofthe population is likely genetically resistant to thePrP sc that causes the disease. Further while the infective dose in humans is not known the dietaryconsumption of known infective tissues brain spinal cord etc. is low.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1595,However it may be yearsbefore the full impact of this disease on the humanpopulation is known. As of 2001 no cases of BSEin cattle had been identiﬁed in the United States and no products had been imported that appear to pose potential risk to either human or animal health. M.

Beforediscussing some of the more prevalent tropicalinfections of today it is worth taking a brief look at the history of a few of these infections. BACKGROUND Many of the infections that we now consider tropi cal used to be found throughout the more temper ate climates of North America and Europe.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1616,For example yellow fever epidemics swept through American cities from the 1600s through 1905 killing thousands of people. Cholera devastatedthe cities of America and Europe before the daysof sewers. The Plague known as the Black Death decimated the populations of medieval Europe. Inthe early part of the twentieth century it wasestimated that there were between 5 million and 7million cases of malaria a year in the United Statesbetween Florida and Connecticut.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1617,Malaria was adisease familiar to the British of the sixteenthcentury and is even described by Shakespeare inHenry V II. i. 123 . Hookworm was the most common cause of anemia in the American south atbeginning of the twentieth century and was onlycontrolled after a massive public health campaign.Good sanitation hygiene and vector control meth ods as well as a rise in the standard of living wereresponsible for the virtual eradication of thesediseases from North America and Europe.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1618,Thefact that so many of these infections are nowconsidered tropical and are found mainly inpoorer developing countries is more a result ofeconomics than it is of climate. There are severalcountries with high rates of tropical infectionsthat do not have tropical climates for example Iran and Afghanistan . The original designation of certain diseases as being tropical can be dated back to the 1898publication of Sir Patrick Manson s Tropical Dis eases A Manual of the Diseases of Warm Climates .
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1619,This volume identiﬁed twelve tropical infectiousdiseases as well as a few other noninfectious dis eases such as pellagra. The book was aimed at British physicians working in the warmer climates of many of the British colonies. Since then the listof tropical infections has expanded to include wellover one hundred infections.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1620,There is no list inexistence that deﬁnitely identiﬁes which infec tions are classiﬁed as tropical most lists include acombination of those infections that are foundexclusively in the tropics as well the large number TROPICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES 1226that though also found in more temperate cli mates are predominantly a problem of develop ing countries with warmer climates. A discussionof tropical infectious diseases is essentially a dis cussion of the infectious diseases of the develop ing world.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1621,As is true of all infectious diseases the causa tive pathogens include viruses bacteria parasites and fungi. Table 1 is a list of some tropical infec tions divided by pathogen. Some infections suchas measles human immunodeﬁciency virus HIV and tuberculosis though found throughout theworld are included in the list as they cause suchsevere morbidity and mortality in tropical countries.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1622,It is estimated that infections cause over 13 million deaths a year in developing countries accounting for approximately 50 percent of alldeaths. Only six diseases cause over 90 percent ofthe deaths attributed to infections pneumonia tuberculosis diarrheal diseases malaria measles and HIV AIDS human immunodeﬁciency virus acquired immunodeﬁciency syndrome . Of these only pneumonia is also a leading cause of death indeveloped countries.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1623,The others are found in de veloped countries but are now controlled eitherthrough vaccination programs as with measles orwith effective medications and public health pro grams. Unfortunately lack of effective health in frastructures poor economies and lack of accessto affordable medications mean that these infec tions will continue to be the cause of signiﬁcantmorbidity and mortality in developing countries.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1624,Approximately 2 billion people one third of the world s population have latent tuberculosis TB infection. Of these 8 million people a yearwill develop active infection and 2 million people ayear will die from the infection. The rates ofinfection and subsequent death are increasing worldwide with new outbreaks occurring in re gions such as Eastern Europe for the ﬁrst time inover forty years.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1625,In regions with high rates of HIV the spread of tuberculosis is greatly accelerated asare the death rates attributable to tuberculosis.The emergence of strains that are resistant to ﬁrst line drugs used in the treatment of TB means thatit is becoming more difﬁcult and more expensive to successfully treat the infection. A variety of bacteria and viruses such as chol era rotavirus and typhoid fever may result indiarrheal illness.

Themorbidity associated with diarrheal illnesses is theresult of repeated episodes of dehydrating andmalnourishing infections in children during theirformative years. One study done in Brazil showedthat such children lost over ﬁve centimeters ofgrowth when compared to a healthy group.

The most vulnerable groups are children under ﬁve and pregnantwomen. Over 90 percent of lethal cases of malariaoccur in sub Saharan Africa.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1629,The deterioration inpublic health systems the movement of peoples asa result of wars and civil unrest and worseningeconomies in malaria endemic countries have re sulted in an increase in the rates of malaria infec tion. Global warming has led to an expansion ofthe normal range of the mosquito habitat andthus to an expansion of the regions where infec tion is a risk. Increasing resistance to drugs used totreat malaria has also meant further spread of thedisease and higher mortality rates.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1630,Measles is a viral infection for which there is a very effective vaccine which unfortunately is oftennot available in developing countries partly be cause of difﬁculty maintaining the cold chain.Measles accounts for almost 1 million childhooddeaths a year especially among malnourished in dividuals. Survivors of the infection may haveresulting disabilities such as brain damage blind ness or deafness. The human immunodeﬁciency virus was ﬁrst recognized in the early 1980s.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1631,By the year 2000 over 33 million people were infected with sub Saharan Africa being one of the worst affectedregions. There is no cure. Medications that controlthe infection are expensive and therefore inacces sible to the majority of infected individuals. Other tropical infections that cause signiﬁcant morbidity and mortality include leprosy leishma niasis schistosomiasis ﬁlariasis and onchocerciasis.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1632,Although the mortality associated with these infec tions is not as great as those described above theycan lead to severe disﬁgurement and disability aswell as a large economic cost and negative socialimpact. For example leprosy a bacterial infectioncaused by Mycobacterium leprae that affects more than 500 000 people a year can result in signiﬁ cant disﬁgurement to the tissues of the face andextremities often leading to severe disability. It isfound in Africa Latin America and SoutheastAsia.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1633,Early diagnosis and appropriate medicationcure the infection and prevent disability. Leishmaniasis a parasitic infection spread by the bite of sand ﬂies is another infection that canresult in severe disﬁgurement and disability. Itcauses a spectrum of clinical manifestations rang ing from discrete cutaneous ulcers to dissemi nated visceral involvement which causes death. Itis estimated that 12 million people worldwide areinfected.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1634,The most severe and lethal form of leish maniasis visceral leishmaniasis also known as kalaazar is increasing in frequency in countries thatalso have high rates of HIV. Lymphatic ﬁlariasis caused by blood borne parasites spread by biting arthropods is one ofthe leading causes of long term disability in theworld.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1635,Infection with these parasitic worms canresult in impairment of lymphatic drainage withresultant marked enlargement of limbs and geni tals a condition sometimes called elephantiasis.Onchocerciasis another ﬁlarial infection afﬂictingalmost 18 million people can cause visual impair ment and blindness. The increasing movements of people and goods worldwide are facilitating the spread of infectiousdiseases. It was estimated that by the late 1990sthere were over 1.4 billion airline passengers an nually.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1636,It is inevitable that along with the move ment of people there will be movement of dis eases. There have been well documented cases ofdiseases such as tuberculosis poliomyelitis me ningococcal meningitis malaria and inﬂuenza be ing brought to Western countries by travelers.

PREVENTION AND TREATMENT Many tropical infections are preventable by means of simple inexpensive and currently availablemethods. For example 25 percent of malaria deathscan be prevented by the use of insecticide impregnated bednets.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1638,Comprehensive childhoodvaccination programs would virtually eliminateinfection with the measles virus. Clean water andgood sanitation and hygiene would signiﬁcantlyreduce the burden of diarrheal illness as wellas other water associated infections such asschistosomiasis. Unfortunately many of these pre vention strategies are not being implemented for avariety of reasons.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1639,Some governments do not makehealth care a priority and the cost of these pro grams is often beyond the means of some of the TROPICAL MEDICINE 1228worst affected countries due to poor and or deteriorating health infrastructures programs of ten cannot be undertaken. Armed conﬂict alsooften leads to an interruption or deterioration ofhealth services. Inexpensive and effective medications are avail able to treat most tropical infectious diseases.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1640,However cost remains a signiﬁcant barrier andthese medications remain unavailable to the vast majority of the world s population. Contributingto this problem are global patent protection lawsthat prohibit the manufacture and distribution ofinexpensive copies of expensive medications pat ented by multinational pharmaceutical companies.Also treatment of many of these diseases such astuberculosis and malaria is now complicated bythe emergence of resistance to ﬁrst line tradi tional medications.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1641,Unfortunately and perhaps understandably for the pharmaceutical industry ﬁnancial incentives to develop new products arelacking for a marketplace in which the world spoorest reside. Without the development of newdrugs and vaccines it is possible that we may notbe able to effectively treat resistant tropical infec tious diseases relegating a signiﬁcant proportionof the world s population to suffer or die needlessly. The list of infections that we need to be con cerned about is not static.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1642,New and reemerginginfectious diseases have become a worldwide prob lem the most important of which is HIV. Fromits initial identiﬁcation in the early 1980s HIVhas become a leading cause of death in a signiﬁ cant number of developing countries. Other ex amples of new infections include hantavirus cryptosporidium and Ebola virus.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1643,Dengue fever an arbovirus almost eradicated from the Americasby 1980 has made a major comeback in Centraland South America as well as in Southeast Asia.Well developed surveillance systems accurate di agnostic tools and an effective public health re sponse are needed in order to identify and containnew infections as they occur.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1644,In summary many of the infections that we currently consider tropical were once endemicin the more temperate climates of developed coun tries but were successfully eradicated with a com bination of public health good sanitation andhygiene and accessible medications. However pre vention and treatment of these infections is beinghampered by war poverty and perhaps mostimportantly by the lack of political will on both a local and global level.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1648,TROPICAL MEDICINE See Tropical Infectious Diseases TRYPANOSOMIASIS Trypanosomiasis also known as African sleeping sickness is an infection endemic to sub Saharan T TEST 1229Africa. It is caused by protozoan parasites called trypanosomes which are spread by the bite of thetsetse ﬂy. There are two subspecies of trypanosomesthat infect humans each causing a different formof the disease.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1649,Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense found in eastern and southern Africa causes an acuteillness leading to death within weeks or months.Trypanosoma brucei gambiense found in western and central Africa causes a more chronic form ofthe illness which may last several years. Both formsof sleeping sickness are fatal if left untreated. It is estimated that approximately 60 million people are at risk for the disease.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1650,Accurate assess ment of the extent of the disease is made difﬁcultby the remoteness of the areas in which it is foundand the variability in the tests used for diagnosis.Trypanosomiasis often occurs focally so scatteredpockets of infection will be found within an en demic region. Following the bite of an infected tsetse ﬂy a scab or chancre often forms.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1651,After an incubationperiod of days to weeks the trypanosomes enterthe blood and lymphatic systems and multiply.During this stage patients may experience head aches fevers sweating rash and malaise. Enlarge ment of lymph glands occurs particularly at theback of the neck. The enlarged nodes may be theonly visible sign during this phase of the infection.Eventually the trypanosomes will invade the cen tral nervous system giving rise to neurologicalsymptoms.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1652,This stage aptly called sleeping sick ness is characterized by headache apathy leth argy and somnolence. Patients may experiencepersonality and cognitive changes tremors andcoordination problems. They become increasinglywasted and drowsy and eventually fall into a comaand die. This progression to death usually occursin months with T. b. rhodesiense and in years with T. b. gambiense .
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1653,Diagnosis is made by microscopic identiﬁca tion of the parasite which may be found in thechancre lymph glands blood or cerebral spinalﬂuid depending on the stage of the disease. Thereare several serologic assays available. The sensitiv ity and speciﬁcity of these tests are variable. Theyare used mainly for epidemiological surveys butthey do have some clinical utility as well. The form of treatment depends on whether the central nervous system CNS is involved.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1654,If thedisease has not affected the CNS suramin orpentamidine may be used. In cases of CNS involve ment melarsoprol is the drug of choice. This is avery toxic drug which may have severe side effects including a fatal encephalopathy. Another effec tive medication for the treatment of T. b. gambiense is eﬂornithine. Unfortunately this drug is notcurrently readily available. Human beings are the main hosts of T. b. gambiense .
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1655,Control of this infection involves rou tine screening of at risk populations treatment ofinfected individuals and control of exposure totsetse ﬂies which often inhabit riverine areas. T. b. rhodesiense is found in savannah areas in antelopes other wild game and domestic cattle so control ofinfection is more complicated and involves thecoordination of medical veterinary agricultural entomological and other services.

T TEST A normal distribution plays a prominent role in tests of hypothesis that involve the mean of apopulation.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1658,In particular if a random sample ofobservations is normally distributed statistical in ferences for the sample mean can be made byconstructing a Z test statistic that follows a stan dard normal distribution. However the use of this T TEST 1230statistic requires knowledge of the true variance of population from which the observations were sam pled. Frequently this quantity is unknown and canonly be estimated using the values obtained throughsampling.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1659,Speciﬁcally an estimate of the samplevariance s 2 can be obtained as follows s2 n i l1 n 1 xi x 2 where n is the total number of observations x is the mean of the sampled observations and xi is the value for the ith observation i 1 2 . . .n . When the population variance is estimated using sam pled data the use of the Z test statistic to performhypothesis testing can lead to biased results.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1660,Asolution to this problem was put forth in 1908 byWilliam Gossett a statistician employed by anIrish brewery who went by the pseudonym Stu dent. Today the Student s t distribution is rou tinely used to perform tests of hypothesis. The Student s t distribution is not a unique distribution but rather a family of distributionswhose shape is symmetric and determined by thenumber of sampled observations or equivalently the number of degrees of freedom.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1661,Like otherprobability distributions the total area under thecurve of a t distribution is equal to one. The p values for tests of hypothesis based on this distri bution can typically be extracted from the pub lished tables that appear as an appendix in moststatistical texts. As the number of degrees of free dom increases the shape of the t distribution con verges to that of the standard normal distribution. The t distribution can be used to compare the mean of a sampled population to some ﬁxed known value.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1662,This statistical test of hypothesis isreferred to as a one sample t test. For example aresearcher might be interested in determiningwhether the average family income among Chi cago residents was higher or lower that the averagefamily income in the entire United States. Supposethat we knew that the average family income in theUnited States was 35 000 per year.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1663,The meanincome from a random sample of Chicago resi dents could be calculated and a one sample t testcould be used to determine whether their meanincome level was signiﬁcantly different from thenational average. This one sample t test statistic iscalculated as follows t df s2 n where x represents the mean of the sampled data µ represents the hypothesized value of this mean and n represents the total number of sampled measures.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1664,In the above example µ would equal 35 000 while x would be the average income calculated using data supplied by n Chicago resi dents. This t statistic has n 1 degrees of freedom. In practice the two sample t test is a more commonly used statistic. This statistic can evaluatewhether or not there are signiﬁcant differences inthe means of two independently sampled popula tions.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1665,In addition to the assumption of indepen dence it is assumed that within each populationthe variable of interest is normally distributed withequal variances. The mathematical derivation ofthis test statistic is as follows t df x1 x2 s2 p n1s2 p n2 x1 x2 1n11n2 s2 p where n1 and n2 are the number of observations in each of the two groups x1 and x2 are the means of the two groups and sp2 is an estimate of the pooled sample variance.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1666,The sample variance is calculatedusing the formula s p2 n1 1 s12 n2 1 s22 n1 n2 2 where s12 and s22 represent the sample variances in the two groups. The total number of degrees offreedom associated with this t test is n 1 n2 2.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1667,To illustrate the application of this test statis tic consider the situation where an investigatorwould like to determine whether infant birthweightwas signiﬁcantly different between mothers whosmoked during pregnancy and those who did not.Suppose that the mean birthweight among teninfants whose mothers smoked was 5 lbs. whilethe mean birthweight among the same number ofinfants whose mothers did not smoke was 8 lbs.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1668,Ifthe pooled sample variance based on the weightmeasurements taken on these twenty infants was 3lbs. then using the above formula the calculated t test statistic would be approximately 3.9 with 18degrees of freedom. The two sided p value associ ated with this test is approximately 0.0006. In TUBERCULOSIS 1231other words there is about a 6 out of 10 000 probability of observing a difference at least aslarge as 3 lbs. by chance alone if there was trulyno association between maternal smoking andbirthweight.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1669,We would therefore conclude thatthe observed mean difference of 3 lbs. was unlikelyto be explained by chance and consider the ob served difference statistically signiﬁcant. When the variances in two groups being com pared are not equal the modiﬁed t test shouldbe used to compare the means. Instead of using acommon pooled estimate of variance t df x1 x2 s2 1n1s2 2n2modified the variance for each group is used in the calcula tion of the t test statistic.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1670,Speciﬁcally where n1 and n2 are the number of observations in each of the two groups x1 and x2 are the means of the two groups and s12 and s22represent the variances of the two groups. Because the exact distribution ofthe modiﬁed t test statistic is difﬁcult to derive it isnecessary to approximate the number of degreesof freedom using the following formula d s 12 n1 s22 n2 2 s12 n1 2 n1 1 s22 n2 2 n2 1 This value of d is rounded down to the nearest integer.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1671,Using the calculated modiﬁed t test statis tic and the estimated number of degrees of free dom the p value can then obtained from theappropriate t distribution to determine whetherthe two means are signiﬁcantly different fromeach other. Paired data is frequently collected in studies of public health. Here each observation in the ﬁrstsample is matched to a unique data point in thesecond sample.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1672,In the technique of self pairing measurements are taken on a single subject orentity at two distinct points in time. One exampleof self pairing is the before and after experimentwhere each individual is examined both beforeand after a certain treatment has been applied.Because the data are no longer independent thetwo sample t test can no longer be used to test thebefore and after means. Instead the paired t test can be used to test the hypothesis that the meandifference of the pairs is equal to zero.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1673,This test isconstructed by taking the mean difference of all observed pairs and dividing this by the standarderror of all observed differences. The degrees offreedom associated with this test statistic is equalto the number of pairs less one. Finally the t distribution plays a role in hy pothesis tests using results obtained frommultivariate regression analysis. Multivariate re gression models are used to describe the associa tion between an outcome variable and a series ofindependent variables.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1674,Computer programs havebeen developed to estimate the value of the modelcoefﬁcients and their standard errors. Tests ofsigniﬁcance about each independent variable canbe performed by taking the ratio of these parame ter estimates and their associated standard errors this ratio follows a t distribution. The number ofdegrees of freedom for these test statistics aredetermined by the number of observations andthe number of independent variables in the ﬁt ted model.

V ILLENEUVE SEE ALSO Normal Distributions Sampling Statistics for Public Health TUBERCULIN TEST See Mantoux Test TUBERCULOSIS Tuberculosis TB an infectious disease has been present throughout ancient and modern history.TB rates in the United States are on the declineafter a resurgence from 1985 to 1992. However TB continues to be a major killer in much of theworld. The implications of this epidemic are glo bal as travel and migration are now part of every day life.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1676,Although the cause diagnosis and treatment and prevention of TB are known paradoxically the disease continues to increase as a public healthchallenge. Caused by a bacterium called Mycobac terium tuberculosis TB spreads via an airborne route from an infectious person coughing sneezing laughing or singing. The bacteria infect mainly TUBERCULOSIS 1232other individuals who have frequent and prolonged contact with a contagious TB case. HISTORY TB s existence dates back many centuries.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1677,There are references to TB in third century B.C.E. Chinese and second century B.C.E. Indian texts Plato and Hippocrates wrote about it around 400 B.C.E. TB was commonly known as consumption in Europe a cause of death for hundreds of thousands in thelate eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. This iswhen TB in close groups was ﬁrst observed andassumed to have a genetic cause since it wascommonly seen in families.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1678,In 1882 Robert Koch s discovery of Mycobac terium tuberculosis led to the recognition of TB as an infectious disease. This discovery also led tointerventions for interrupting transmission fromperson to person. Beginning in the late 1880s TB patients were treated in sanitoria with various modali ties including exposure to fresh air exercise andnourishment. About 50 percent of patients recov ered or had long term remission.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1679,However as isknown today their cure was not due to thetreatments administered but perhaps to self healingmechanisms.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1680,In the early twentieth century public health interventions became key in controlling the spreadof TB in the cities where TB was most prevalent.For example Herman M. Biggs General MedicalOfﬁcer of New York City actively catalogued listsof TB patients and enforced isolation and environ mental mechanisms to control TB including theopening of a TB hospital to quarantine patients.Between 1914 and 1923 the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company conducted the FraminghamTuberculosis Project using community nurses tovisit the homes of its clients to do assessments teach health practices and collect data for re search and policy making purposes.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1681,The projectwas in response to a high rate of TB related mortal ity among Metropolitan customers. As a result mortality rates for TB in the Metropolitan pooldeclined by 68 percent. Beginning in 1921 the Bacille Calmette Guerin BCG vaccine was used to prevent TB. Still used inmany parts of the world but not in the United States the vaccine is not effective except perhapsin infants. The discovery of streptomycin in 1943brought drug treatment for TB.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1682,Between 1943 and1952 two more TB drugs para amino salicylicacid PAS and isoniazid INH were discovered.Sanitoria began to close in the early 1970s as TBcould be now be treated on an outpatient basis asevidenced by success in the decrease in TB rateswith combined drug treatment and infection control mechanisms. RESURGENCE By 1985 there were 22 201 cases of TB in the United States the lowest number recorded sincenational case reporting began in 1953.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1683,However rates then began to increase until in 1992 casespeaked at 26 673. The human immunodeﬁciencyvirus HIV epidemic was a major contributor asits victims are at higher risk for developing activedisease once infected with TB bacteria. Migration from countries with high rates of TB added to thenumber.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1684,Also improper or inadequate drug treat ment for TB has led to drug resistant strains.Finally medical education stressed TB to a lesser degree in academic curricula and funding andinterest in TB control programs had dwindledwith decreased cases. Most authorities feel that thelatter reason was the most important. Response to the American TB resurgence re sulted in increased funding for TB control pro grams. This gave greater access to TB treatmentthrough health departments.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1685,The health depart ments were responsible not only for treating cases but for surveillance outreach case management and treatment for those who had been exposed toinfectious TB cases. Directly observed therapyshort course DOTS the observation of the inges tion of medication has now become the basis forthe worldwide standard of TB care.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1686,DOTS in cludes ﬁve elements government commitment tosustained TB control activities case detection andself reporting to health services standardized treat ment regimen of six to eight months for at least allconﬁrmed infectious cases with directly observedtreatment DOT for at least the initial two months aregular uninterrupted supply of all essential anti TB drugs and a standardized recording and re porting system that allows assessment of treatmentresults for each patient and of the TB control TULAREMIA 1233program overall.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1687,DOTS is presently available to 25 percent of the world s TB patients but its accept ance is slowly increasing. There was also an in crease in TB educational interventions via thepublic health sector and medical schools. Newdrug trials did not create new drugs but createdvariations on existing drugs and regimens. TBrates began to decrease again in 1994 and as of1999 they were at an all time low of 17 528 cases inthe United States.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1688,Globally there are still eightmillion new cases of TB annually with three mil lion deaths. Clearly even with the exemplary levelof achievement domestically TB cannot be con trolled anywhere unless it is controlled everywhere. THE FUTURE Although one of the Healthy People 2010 goals calls for TB elimination from this country the UnitedStates is still far from that goal. Many interventionsneed to be continued despite falling rates.

TULAREMIA Tularemia is a potentially severe and fatal bacterial zoonosis caused by a gram negative coccobacillus Francisella tularensis .
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1692,Tularemia occurs only in the Northern Hemisphere most commonly in theUnited States and Europe. In nature infectionoccurs mostly in rodents rabbits and hares.Humans become infected by handling infectiousanimal carcasses eating or drinking contaminatedfood or water being bitten by infective ticks ﬂies or mosquitoes or by inhaling contaminated aero sols. The disease is not transmitted person to person.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1693,The more severe F. tularensis strain A occurs only in the United States and Canada whilethe milder strain B occurs throughout the North ern Hemisphere. Tularemia in humans is relatively rare and it takes several forms depending on the routeof inoculation. The ulceroglandular form is themost common. It is characterized by an ulcerthat develops where infection has penetrated the skin accompanied by painful swelling of nearbylymph glands.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1694,Other forms include the glandular oculoglandular oropharyngeal pneumonic intesti nal and septic typhoidal types. Following ausual incubation period of three to ﬁve days some times longer all forms have similar acute onsetsof fever headache musculoskeletal pain progres sive weakness and weight loss. Patients with tula remia pneumonia typically develop a cough withminimal or no sputum production chest pain anddifﬁculty in breathing.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1695,Patients with the septicform sometimes develop complications of bleed ing respiratory failure and shock. All forms canbe cured by treatment with antibiotics such asstreptomycin gentamicin or tetracyclines. Thedisease can be fatal if not treated early with appro priate antibiotics. Tularemia is best prevented by avoiding sick or dead animals protecting against tick and insect TYPHOID 1234bites and by sanitary practices that protect against contamination of food and water by infectedanimals.

TYPHOID Typhoid or enteric fever is a serious systemic disease caused by a bacillus Salmonella typhi . Paratyphoid fever is closely related though gener ally less severe.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1697,The enteric fevers have an incuba tion period of one to four weeks followed by aslow onset and prolonged course primarily affect ing the gastrointestinal tract. There is a low feverand severe toxemia. A skin rash may occur in theearly stages and later other organs liver kidneys bone marrow brain may be invaded. Typhoid isfatal in about 3 to 4 percent of cases with higherproportions occurring where diagnostic and treat ment facilities are inadequate.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1698,Diagnosis some times can be made clinically on the basis of patienthistory and physical examination but usually de pends on isolating the organism from feces orblood culture. Worldwide there are about 16 mil lion cases annually resulting in 600 000 deaths inthe United States there are usually less than 500cases a year. Typhoid is transmitted in feces usually in polluted water though sometimes in food that hasbeen prepared under unhygienic conditions by aconvalescent or chronic carrier.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1699,Humans are theonly host for typhoid bacilli but paratyphoid canbe carried and transmitted by domestic animals.Cases continue to excrete the infective organismsin feces and sometimes in urine for varying peri ods sometimes up to several months after appar ent clinical recovery. A chronic e.g. virtually per manent carrier state occurs in a small number ofcases Typhoid Mary was a notorious example.There may be other intermediaries between the human source and the victim who consumes contaminated water or food.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1700,For instance water ina river estuary polluted with raw sewage contain ing typhoid bacilli may be ingested by shellﬁsh ormussels and these are then infective. It does notrequire a massive dose of viable typhoid bacilli tocause the disease. There are many well documentedcases of typhoid following ingestion of minusculeamounts of contaminated water or food. For in stance it sufﬁces to eat a few lettuce leaves from asalad that was washed in contaminated water.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1701,Forthis reason travelers to regions where typhoid isendemic must exercise extreme caution in whatthey eat and drink. All those who travel to placeswhere typhoid occurs should also be offered pro phylactic typhoid vaccine. In the past this hasrequired several injections of vaccine which ofteninduced painful and sometimes unpleasantly toxicreactions. An oral vaccine is now available. Cases of typhoid are treated with antibiotics and notiﬁcation to public health authorities ismandatory.

Epi demic or louse borne typhus is also known ashistoric typhus European typhus jail war camp or ship fever. Epidemic typhus is caused by Rickettsia prowazekii a small gram negative obligately intracellular bacterium. The disease starts with anabrupt onset of symptoms following a one to twoweek incubation period.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1710,Clinical manifestations oftyphus include intense headache chills fever andmyalgia. A characteristic rash develops on thefourth to seventh day of disease. It ﬁrst appears onthe upper trunk and then becomes generalized involving the whole body except the face palms and soles. As the disease progresses particularly inuntreated patients signiﬁcant alterations of men tal status from stupor to coma are observed. Inpatients with severe disease hypotension and re nal failure are common.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1711,Epidemic typhus is a life threatening illness even for young previouslyhealthy persons. Fatal outcomes are observed inup to 40 percent of untreated cases. Transmission and Epidemiology. Epidemic typhus is a disease of humans. The human bodylouse Pediculus humanus corporis is responsible for transmission of the agent from human to human.Charles Nicolle 1866 1936 ﬁrst experimentally established this fact and he received the NobelPrize in 1928 for his contributions.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1713,Epidemic typhuscommonly occurs in cold climates where peoplelive in overcrowded unsanitary conditions withfew opportunities to change their clothes or bathe.Such conditions often occur during war and natu ral disasters which typically facilitate louse infesta tion. The history of typhus is in fact largely thehistory of men in battle. The disease has beencredited with deciding the outcome of more bat tles than any general s best laid strategy.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1714,Epidemictyphus is currently prevalent in mountainous re gions of Africa South America and Asia. TYPHUS EPIDEMIC 1236Recovery from epidemic typhus results in nonsterile immunity permitting the persistenceof R. prowazekii between epidemics. Individuals who have been infected sometimes suffer a relapsein the form of Brill Zinsser disease which has thesymptoms of classic typhus but is usually milder. Inthe United States R. prowazekii is also transmitted by the Orchopeas howarolii ﬂeas of ﬂying squir rels.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1715,Persons exposed to infected ﬂeas sporadicallyacquire an infection that is referred to as sylvatictyphus and is typically milder than classic epi demic typhus.

Ultraviolet radiation UVR comprises aspectrum of electromagnetic waves of differentwavelengths subdivided for convenience into threebands which are measured in nanometers nm 1 UVA black light 315 to 400 nm 2 UVB 280 to 315 nm and 3 UVC which is germi cidal 200 to 280 nm.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1719,Visible light consists ofelectromagnetic waves varying in wavelength fromabout 400 violet to 700 nm red . None of these radiations penetrates deeply into human tissue so that the injuries they causeare conﬁned chieﬂy to the skin and eyes. Reactionsof the skin to UVR are common among fair skinned people and include sunburn skin cancers basal cell and squamuous cell carcinomas and toa lesser extent melanomas aging of the skin solarelastoses and solar keratoses.

The effects of UVR result chieﬂy from its absorption in DNA resulting in the cross linkageof pyriminide nucleotides which in turn may cause mutations in exposed cells.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1721,Sensitivity toUVR may be decreased by DNA repair defects by agents that inhibit the repair enzymes andby photosensitizing agents such as psoralens sulfonamides tetracyclines and coal tar that in crease the absorption of UVR in DNA. To prevent injury by sunlight excessive expo sure to the sun should be avoided especiallyby fair skinned individuals and protective cloth ing UVR screening lotions or creams and UVR blocking sunglasses should be used when neces sary.

For example the measurement of an environmental pollutantwill be subject to errors in instrument design sampling rate and analytical methods.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1727,These er rors will lead to measured concentrations that mayapproach a true value but will not be 100 percentaccurate due to random or systematic processesduring detection. Variables or quantities that aresubject to uncertainty include 1 empirical met rics e.g. concentrations 2 constants e.g. dif fusion coefﬁcients 3 decision variables e.g. acceptable unacceptable limits and 4 model ing domains or boundaries e.g. grid size .
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1728,Ofthese variables the empirical metrics are usuallythe most uncertain since each may have manyindependent variables that can individually orsynergistically control the total uncertainty attachedto a measurement. There are different sources of uncertainty for a variable including 1. Random error which is derived from weaknesses or imperfections in meas urement techniques or independentinterferences. 2.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1729,Systematic error which is due to biases in the measurement analytical technique ormodels these can be associated withcalibration detector malfunctions or as sumptions about processes that affectvariables. 3. Unpredictability which is due to the inability to control the stability of a systemor process such as the partitioning of asemivolatile compound between the vaporand particle phase in the atmosphere.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1730,Other sources of less importance include the lack of an empirical basis for individual values theoretical predictions and dependence corre lation of variables interdependence of controllingvariables in a system . Some uncertainties in vari ables or systems can be reduced either by improv ing the methods of measurement and analysis orby improving the formulation of a model.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1731,Somenonreducible uncertainty however is inherentwithin the physical chemical or biological systemthat is being studied and can only be quantiﬁed bystatistical analyses of data collected from the system. A number of methods are used to quantify the uncertainty of a system. Analytical uncertaintyanalysis involves a description of the output orresponse variable that is a function of the uncer tainty of each input variables independent thataffects the response variable.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1732,This technique isonly useful for simple systems however morecomplex systems require sophisticated techniquesto determine uncertainty and its propagation withina system such as Monte Carlo distributional meth ods Latin hypercube sampling and the stochasticresponse surface method. At times uncertainty is mistaken for variabil ity.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1733,Variability consists of the range of values thattruly can be ascribed to a variable within a system.In principle variability is based upon the differ ences in a variable frequently found within a sys tem e.g. a population distribution or concentra tion pattern . It is based on the number andfrequency of observations of one or more vari ables in the system or on the probability of theoccurrence of a speciﬁc value e.g. concentration in the system under consideration.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1741,Working in partnershipwith governments as well as health related organi zations notably the World Health Organization WHO UNICEF is active in programs rangingfrom immunization and oral rehydration cam paigns to water and sanitation projects and fromthe ﬁght against acute respiratory infections to theelimination of polio and micronutrient deﬁcien cies. Its contribution to international public health particularly for children and mothers has beensigniﬁcant and extensive.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1742,Indeed in the last twodecades of the twentieth century UNICEF with itsactivist leadership helped shape the agenda ofinternational health. THE EVOLUTION OF UNICEF The United Nations General Assembly created the UN International Children s Emergency Fund as atemporary agency on December 11 1946 to pro vide urgent relief aid to children in countriesravaged by World War II in Europe and Asia. Itsassistance consisted of food shelter and medi cine.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1743,In 1953 the General Assembly gave the fund UNICEF 1240a continuing mandate to help needy children in developing countries and dropped the words in ternational and emergency from its name. Bythen however the acronym UNICEF had be come so well known that the Assembly retained it. With infant mortality as high as 150 to 200 per 1 000 live births in many parts of Asia LatinAmerica and Africa UNICEF soon turned itsattention to the urgent health issues of childrenand mothers.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1744,Guidance for such work came from ajoint WHO UNICEF committee on health poli cies that involved members of the governing boardsof both institutions. In recent years the UN Popu lation Fund UNFPA has also joined the committee. In the early 1950s infectious diseases were rampant in many parts of the world and UNICEFbecame heavily involved in campaigns against thosediseases that could be prevented or for whichthere was a ready treatment.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1745,UNICEF furnishedequipment and supplies to countries for mass disease campaigns with WHO providing the tech nical support. These campaigns included malaria yaws tuberculosis typhus trachoma and leprosy.In its efforts to reduce infant mortality UNICEFalso promoted the training of traditional birthattendants and provided equipment medicine and transport for maternal and child health services.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1746,The 1960s saw UNICEF working with the WHO and many governments in extending ruralhealth services and with the Food and AgricultureOrganization of the United Nations FAO in ﬁght ing child malnutrition. Planning for the develop ment of the whole child instead of a morepiecemeal approach became the basis of UNICEF sbroader program thrust that opened the door forits focus on education as part of preparation for life.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1747,NOBEL PEACE PRIZE In 1965 UNICEF was awarded the Noble Peace Prize thus linking its services for future genera tions with peace building. The Prize provided asolid base from which to build its effective role inadvocacy for children. UNICEF was the ﬁrst UN body to take up the issue of family planning.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1748,Though the controversialsubject was presented in the context of responsi ble parenthood to UNICEF s executive board in1966 after an unprecedented and acrimonious debate the deeply divided board deferred its deci sion by one year and it eventually took a relativelymild stance on the issue. As UNFPA was created in1967 the pressure for UNICEF to take up the issuehead on was eased.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1749,By the early 1970s UNICEF shifted its empha sis to the provision of basic services for children including education while it maintained a pre dominance of its fund allocations to health pro grams. Though UNICEF changed its stance fromits origin as a relief agency to that of a develop ment organization it continued to respond toemergencies. In 1974 in response to the globaleconomic food and energy crises UNICEF de clared a child emergency and launched a specialprogram to meet the urgent needs that existed.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1750,Also in the 1970s communication activities in support of programs made their appearance as a regular feature of UNICEF programs. These ef forts were later broadened to include all relevantelements of society for a common objective anapproach now recognized as an effective develop ment strategy by many development agencies andoften referred to as social mobilization.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1751,ALMA ATA AND IYC After two decades of development and frustrated by the slow progress for a vast majority of the ruralpopulation public health professionals and devel opment specialists began looking for alternativeapproaches to health care. Their efforts culmi nated in the 1978 Alma Ata Conference cospon sored by WHO and UNICEF which produced theDeclaration of Alma Ata on Primary Health Care PHC .
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1752,The declaration codiﬁed earlier efforts byhealth pioneers in getting health care to the ruralpoor and it deﬁned a new philosophy of healththat was for the people and by the people. This represented a revolutionary redeﬁnition of healthcare and involved the training and employment oflay workers to tackle speciﬁc tasks at the commu nity level with appropriate referrals to secondaryand tertiary facilities.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1753,The declaration called for amultisectoral approach to health based on theprinciples of social justice equity self reliance and the use of appropriate technology. The year 1979 was called by the UN General Assembly the International Year of the Child IYC UNICEF 1241and UNICEF was designated as IYC secretariat. A network of national IYC committees carried out abroad range of country level activities consider ably expanding UNICEF s level of political advo cacy and presaging UNICEF s activism of the 1980s.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1754,CHILD SURVIVAL AND DEVELOPMENT REVOLUTION AND GOBI In 1982 UNICEF launched its Child Survival and Development Revolution CSDR which focusedon four inexpensive interventions to reduce childdeaths.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1755,The acronym GOBI represents the four program components of CSDR growth monitor ing to detect early signs of child malnutrition oralrehydration to prevent death by dehydration as aconsequence of diarrhea breast feeding to stopthe unhealthy and often deadly effects of infantformula in poor communities and immunizationagainst six vaccine preventable diseases polio mea sles tuberculosis whooping cough tetanus anddiphtheria .
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1756,Subsequently UNICEF added foodsecurity female education and family planning tocomplement GOBI. Initially the WHO expressed caution because it viewed GOBI as vertical interventions in con trast to the PHC approach which called for a morehorizontal approach that would strengthen healthsystems. UNICEF was able to reassure WHO ofﬁ cials that GOBI programs were meant to establishentry points for PHC and the WHO became apartner in GOBI activities.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1757,It also joined UNICEFin sponsoring the Bamako Initiative which aimed at making available essential drugs to African coun tries as part of PHC but with cost recovery andcommunity management as key elements of theinitiative. The term child survival proved an effec tive tool to garner considerable extra resourcesfor child health programs.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1758,GOBI programs in volving broad scale social mobilization and theparticipation of many nongovernmental organiza tions became dominant public health activities inmost developing countries in the 1980s. The oralrehydration and immunization programs havesaved millions of children s lives annually.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1759,Alongwith GOBI UNICEF also started a global effort inhealth education with its Facts for Life healthmessages in which WHO and UNESCO were alsoassociated.WORLD SUMMIT ON CHILDREN Following the initial success of GOBI UNICEF engaged in promoting and organizing the WorldSummit for Children in 1990 which brought morethan seventy heads of state and representatives ofmore than eighty member states to New York for atwo day meeting.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1760,The summit was precedent set ting as it was the largest such gathering and theﬁrst summit on social issues. It produced a declara tion a plan of action and a set of goals to beachieved by the year 2000 most of which were inthe public health domain. UNICEF followed upthe summit with individual national plans of ac tion to reach the goals and has published anannual Progress of Nations to monitor and report on progress.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1761,Concurrent with the summit preparation the movement to turn the Declaration of the Rights ofthe Child into the convention made headway.In 1990 the General Assembly adopted the con vention and thus far all member states of theUN have signed the convention and all but theUnited States and Somalia have ratiﬁed the treaty.UNICEF s current programs are now ﬁrmly set inthe context of rights.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1762,In recent years UNICEF hasnot only successfully promoted the convention but has also undertaken programs in the ﬁelds ofchild labor and the removal of land mines. There have been impressive gains as a result of UNICEF s contribution to various public healthprograms. About 7 million young lives are nowsaved each year as a result of immunization andoral rehydration. Polio has been eliminated fromthe Americas. Guinea worm cases in Africa havebeen reduced by 97 percent.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1763,An estimated 90million infants worldwide are protected from asigniﬁcant loss of intelligence quotient and learn ing ability because their families use iodized saltthat stops iodine deﬁciency. In spite of the gains the review of the year 2000 goals scheduled to takeplace in September 2001 is likely to show that themajority of the targets have not been met. HIV AIDS human immunodeﬁciency virus acquiredimmunodeﬁciency syndrome has become a ma jor killer of children in Africa.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1764,The gap betweencountries and within countries has continued towiden. Few countries have paid heed to the Sum mit For Children call for 20 percent of national development investment in the social sector and UNICEF 124220 percent of international development assist ance in the social ﬁeld.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1765,With its role in the summit however UNICEF played a major role in setting the internationalpublic health agenda for the last decade of thetwentieth century and the General Assembly Spe cial Session for Children in September 2001 islikely to inﬂuence public health activities in ﬁrstdecade or two of the new millennium. UNICEF faces the twenty ﬁrst century invigor ated by prospects in tackling problems that impactharshly on children in developing countries.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1766,Withdeepening poverty and a widening gap betweenthe rich and poor plus escalating violence as aresult of armed conﬂict and civil disturbances child health and women s health will remain majorfoci of UNICEF. Malaria immunization and micronutrient dis orders are among old problems receiving substan tial new infusions of funds. HIV AIDS programsand safe motherhood activities will also be ex panded in the years to come.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1767,Given the activism ofmany nongovernmental organizations including secular professional and service based organiza tions and the potential collaboration of the com mercial sector UNICEF s cooperation with thecivil society is likely to increase in the years to come. FUNDING SOURCES Beginning in 1946 with a modest residue of funds from the defunct UN Relief and RehabilitationAgency UNICEF has grown to be a sizable devel opment and humanitarian organization with anannual budget of around 1 billion.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1768,It operatesentirely on voluntary contributions from both gov ernmental and private sources. In addition toregular contributions many governments also makespecial contributions for speciﬁc purposes espe cially during emergencies. A network of thirty seven national committees registered as nonproﬁtentities in the industrialized countries inform thepublic about the needs and rights of the child andraise funds to support UNICEF.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1769,UNICEF has undertaken pioneering work with public personalities including those in the per forming arts or athletics to generate public sup port for public health issues. A roster of goodwillambassadors provides effective support in reach ing speciﬁc audiences. Income from private sourcesincludes the sale of greeting cards the Halloween Trick for Treat for UNICEF campaign televisionappeals and special events such as concerts andsports activities.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1770,Substantial grants from private foundations such as the ones created by TedTurner and Bill Gates are making private income an increasingly important resource for UNICEF. As an operating agency of the United Nations UNICEF is headed by an executive director who isappointed by the Secretary General of the UN inconsultation of its thirty six member executiveboard. Board members are in turn elected by theEconomic and Social Council of the UN.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1771,Therehave only been four executive directors all U.S.citizens since its inception. Maurice Pate a bankerwith experience in humanitarian relief was theﬁrst. Pate steered the organization in its formativeyears and built its foundation. Henry R. Labouisse a lawyer and the ﬁrst foreign aid chief for Presi dent John F. Kennedy succeeded Pate. James P.Grant another lawyer and president of the Over seas Development Council followed Labouisse.Grant launched CSDR GOBI and orchestratedthe UN Summit for Children.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1772,Carol Bellamy alawyer and a former Director of the Peace Corps succeeded Grant as executive director in 1995. With a global staff of nearly 5 600 UNICEF operates from its headquarters at the United Na tions in New York.

While the problem of uninsuranceis not unknown in other industrialized countries the magnitude of the problem is greatest in theUnited States where the social safety net is lessextensive.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1776,In the United States nearly all personssixty ﬁve years old and older are covered by at leastMedicare. In 1999 an estimated 42.5 million Ameri cans of all ages had no health insurance coverage.Among children up to age eighteen 14 percentwere uninsured in 1999. The proportion of thepopulation without any coverage has been increas ing steadily over the past two decades.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1777,In 1999 however coverage increased among most popula tion groups although it is unclear whether thisrepresents a new trend or simply a ﬂuctuation. Because more than 80 percent of persons under age sixty ﬁve who have any health carecoverage obtain it through employment decreasesand increases in employment based health insur ance coverage are the primary determinants of thenumber of uninsured people.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1778,Thus the number ofuninsured had been increasing over the long run primarily due to declining employment basedhealth insurance. In the United States the population groups with the highest uninsured rates are low incomepersons both in working and nonworking fami lies people of color particularly Latinos youngadults workers employed in small ﬁrms and work ers employed less than full time throughout theyear.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1779,Over 80 percent of all the uninsured areworkers or are in a family headed by a workingadult and about half are in families headed by aperson employed full time.Health insurance coverage is the second strong est predictor of use of health care services afterhealth status. The lack of health insurance is widelyregarded as the primary barrier to accessing andusing health care services particularly for preven tive care and for management of chronic conditions.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1781,Organized efforts to protect and assistrefugees while ﬁnding lasting solutions to theirproblems can be traced back to 1919 and thefounding of the League of Nations. Due to thelarge numbers of refugees that resulted from WorldWar I the Russian revolution and the collapse ofthe Ottoman Empire the League of Nations in1921 created the position of High Commissionerto deal with the problems of displaced persons.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1782,Initially the ofﬁce of the High Commissioner addressed the needs of refugees from Europe butlater became more involved with displaced per sons from other nations including Syria. At thattime refugee assistance focused on deﬁning thestatus of refugees helping them with employ ment and protecting them from further expulsion.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1783,In 1945 The League of Nations was replaced by the United Nations UN and in 1947 the UNcreated a new agency called the International Refu gee Organization IRO to deal with matters affect ing displaced persons. However this organizationonly addressed the needs of refugees from Europe.In 1951 the ofﬁce of the United Nations HighCommissioner for Refugees UNHCR was cre ated to replace the IRO.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1784,In contrast to the former UNITED STATES AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT USAID 1244organization the UNHCR was charged with ad dressing refugee problems around the world.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1785,The main role of The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is to protect and assistrefugees in ﬁnding durable solutions to their dis placement addressing their special needs andpromoting and monitoring states adherence tothe 1951 UN Refugee Convention in order toprovide adequate protection to the refugees intheir respective territories. UNHCR activities changed signiﬁcantly dur ing its ﬁrst half century of existence.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1786,For example the scale of UNHCR operations was greatly in creased with ofﬁces in more than 120 nationsaround the world in 2001. In addition to perma nent solutions to the long term needs of refugees the organization provides assistance with manymore immediate concerns for survival. Initially the UNHCR focused primarily on facilitating theﬂow of refugees. Now it also provides materialsupport such as food shelter health care educa tion and other related social services.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1787,It has alsodesigned special programs to meet the speciﬁcneeds of groups such as women children adoles cents the elderly and those who are sufferingfrom the effects of war trauma. Additionally theUNHCR has developed programs that assist dis placed people within their own countries returnees asylum seekers and stateless people.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1788,Finally theUNHCR works hand in hand with other UnitedNations agencies peacekeepers military forces regional agencies human rights organizations andother international and local organizations andagencies. Since its establishment in 1951 UNHCR has had as its primary mission the goal of meeting theneeds of those forcibly displaced.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1789,However theagency faces continuing challenges such as limitedfunding difﬁcult working environments militarythreats large numbers of displaced persons andoften overwhelmingly poor health conditions. Find ing clear lasting and meaningful solutions torefugee problems around the world is extremelydifﬁcult due to complex political economic so cial and related barriers.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1790,However with morethan 20 million refugees worldwide today andanother 24 million displaced persons there is anobvious need for the UNHCR and other humani tarian organizations to work jointly to ensure peaceand tranquility by mobilizing resources that sup port displaced persons.

The fortunes ofthe United States are closely linked to those ofother nations. Air pollution the AIDS acquiredimmunodeﬁciency syndrome epidemic rapidpopulation growth and deforestation are only afew examples of the many problems in the devel oping world that touch American lives.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1797,U.S. devel opment programs reﬂect the nation s compassionfor the poorest of the poor and America s interest in a more prosperous and peaceful world. Foreign assistance is seen as an investment in creating the markets of the future preventingcrises and helping advance democracy and pros perity. Foreign aid creates U.S. jobs and advancesAmerican economic well being.

This growth supported nearly 2 million U.S. jobs. For eign assistance has often resulted in a huge payoffin terms of creating export markets for U.S. goodsand services. For example the United States nowexports more to South Korea in just one year thanwas given to that country in total foreign assistanceduring the 1960s and 1970s.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1800,HUMANITARIAN RELIEF The United States has a long and generous tradi tion of providing assistance to the victims of man made and natural disasters. Humanitarian assist ance has been viewed as both an act of nationalconscience and an investment in the future. USAIDis the world leader in providing assistance to thevictims of ﬂoods famine conﬂict and other crisesaround the globe.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1801,Each year the U.S. government provides food shelter material and relief assistance to millions ofpeople around the world who are affected bydisasters and conﬂict. For example following themass exodus from Rwanda to Zaire in 1994 tens ofthousands of refugees lost their lives due to acholera epidemic that swept through refugee camps.USAID Disaster Assistance Response Teams andU.S. military forces were sent to the region to assistin establishing a clean water distribution system tocombat the epidemic.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1802,These efforts along withother donors helped stem one of the largest hu manitarian crises of the decade. CHILD HEALTH PROGRAMS Among the most important of USAID s public health programs have been its child health pro grams. USAID has supported child health pro grams since 1975 intensifying its efforts in 1985with the Child Survival Initiative.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1803,The initiative carried out in collaboration with host govern ments and international organizations has resultedin a 10 percent decline in infant mortality inUSAID assisted countries. Today more than 4 mil lion infant and child deaths are prevented annu ally due to health services provided by USAIDand its partners.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1805,It is estimated to save the lives of 1million children annually and is one of the mostimportant medical advances of the century. USAIDﬁnanced the basic research on ORT and has ledthe global effort to ensure that ORT is widelyavailable and correctly used. ORT has been suc cessfully used in recent cholera epidemics in LatinAmerica Asia and Africa as well as in treatingepidemics in refugee camps in Rwanda and Zaire. Acute Respiratory Infections ARI .

Maternal Health Programs. Over 600 000 women die annually of causes related to preg nancy and childbirth. The vast majority of womenin the developing world prefer to give birth athome.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1818,The major immediate causes of maternalmortality hemorrhage obstructed labor eclamp sia a serious complication which includes highblood pressure seizures and sometimes bleed ing and unsafe abortions are preventable withknown technologies. In addition millions of womensuffer direct complications of pregnancy and de livery the consequences of which include decreasedquality of life compromised ability to care forchildren and diminished productivity.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1819,USAID along with the World Bank and UNICEF have made efforts to reduce maternalmortality and promote maternal health by sup porting cost effective approaches to improve preg nancy and reproductive health services the in creased utilization of essential obstetric services and improved quality of care through training andquality assurance programs.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1820,Speciﬁcally effortshave been directed toward promoting behavioralchange in those instances where traditional prac tices are harmful such as restricting nutrient rich UNITED STATES AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT USAID 1248foods during pregnancy or speeding labor with potentially harmful local herbs and training birthattendants nurses and midwives in the use ofclean and safe birthing techniques. Support hasalso been provided for tetanus toxoid immuniza tion of mothers to prevent neonatal tetanus.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1821,Family Planning. Further reductions in ma ternal illness and death requires making familyplanning services available to all who need them.Twenty ﬁve percent of maternal deaths could beprevented through the provision of family plan ning services that allow women to prevent un wanted pregnancies and unsafe abortions and totime their pregnancies for greater safety.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1822,Morethan 100 million couples in developing countrieswould like to space or limit births but lack accu rate information and access to quality family plan ning services. Improving access to family planning is also essential to improving child survival. Babies bornless than two years apart are twice as likely to die inthe ﬁrst year of life as those born after an intervalof at least two years.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1823,If the mother of an infantbecomes pregnant again too soon she may discon tinue breast feeding putting her infant at greaterrisk of illness and death. Adequate birth spacingcan prevent one in four infant deaths in develop ing countries. In addition children born to women younger than twenty years old are more likely to die beforetheir ﬁrst birthday than those born to mothersbetween the ages of twenty and twenty nine.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1824,Child ren born to mothers over forty and born to motherwho have already had three or more children arealso more likely to die. One hundred thousandwomen die each year from the consequences ofunsafe abortions. Family planning enables cou ples to prevent unintended pregnancies therebyprotecting themselves from the risks of unsafeabortions. Since 1965 family planning programs sup ported by USAID have helped prevent unintendedpregnancies in over seventy countries.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1825,USAID sup ports efforts to strengthen the provision of familyplanning information and services as well as re search to expand the choice of contraceptive meth ods and improve the quality of care. Contraceptiveuse has increased dramatically in many countries from less than 10 percent in 1965 to over 45percent in 2000. More than 50 million couples worldwide use family planning as a direct result ofUSAID programs.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1826,As a result the average numberof children per family has dropped from morethan six to just over four. Family planning pro grams are improving maternal health by contribut ing to declining abortion rates in Eastern Europe.Family planning has also helped prevent the spreadof HIV AIDS by encouraging condom use andother reproductive health measures. HIV AIDS. In December 2000 the World Health Organization WHO reported that morethan 47 million people had been infected withHIV.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1827,The vast majority of people infected withHIV remain asymptomatic for years allowing thedisease to spread unknowingly. As the epidemic ofAIDS evolves it creates new pressures for overbur dened social health and economic infrastruc tures in countries where resources are alreadylimited and competing demands are increasing.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1828,USAID has initiated HIV AIDS prevention programs in ﬁfty countries in the developing world providing prevention education training techni cal and ﬁnancial support and the sale or distribu tion of condoms in developing countries.

The commis sion has jurisdiction over about 15 000 types ofconsumer products from automatic drip coffeemakers to toys to lawn mowers.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1834,Other federalagencies have jurisdiction over certain speciﬁcproducts such as motor vehicles foods drugs cosmetics alcohol tobacco ﬁrearms pesticides aircraft and boats. The CPSC enforces other laws in addition to the Consumer Product Safety Act. The Federal Hazardous Substances Act FHSA requires thelabeling of hazardous household substances. A1988 amendment to the FHSA the Labeling ofHazardous Art Materials Act requires special la beling of certain art materials.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1835,The 1994 ChildSafety Protection Act pertains to toys balls andother possible choking hazards to children. Underthat act the CPSC also developed a bicycle helmet safety standard. The Poison Prevention PackagingAct requires child resistant packaging for certaindrugs and hazardous household substances. TheCPSC also issues and enforces regulations underthe Flammable Fabrics Act and the RefrigeratorSafety Act. The president of the United States nominates the CPSC commissioners who must be conﬁrmedby the Senate.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1836,One of these commissioners servesas chairman. While the CPSA provides for ﬁvecommissioners in recent years Congress has ap propriated money only for three. MECHANISMS OF CONSUMER SAFETY To accomplish its mission to reduce the unreason able risk of injuries and deaths associated withconsumer products the CPSC has certain tools atits disposal. Recalls. The CPSC can initiate recalls of dan gerous consumer products resulting in their re pair replacement or a refund of their purchaseprice.

Thecommission is especially vigilant about checkingfor potentially unsafe toys and children s products. Mandatory Safety Standards. The CPSC is sues and enforces mandatory safety standards. Forexample to reduce deaths and injuries associatedwith children under age ﬁve who play with ciga rette lighters a mandatory safety standard wasestablished requiring disposable and novelty light ers to be child resistant.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1838,The CPSC can also banconsumer products if no feasible standard wouldadequately protect the public and it can seek civiland criminal penalties against companies thatbreak the law. Voluntary Standards. The CPSC works with industry to develop many voluntary safety stan dards. This method was used to develop a volun tary safety standard on baby walkers making themless likely to fall down stairs.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1839,In addition the CPSCmay ensure safer products by meeting with compa nies and getting them to agree to change theirproduct. This happened in addressing the prob lem of young children strangling in the loops ofwindow blind and curtain cords. The commission UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE USDA 1250met with manufacturers and persuaded them to eliminate the loops in these cords. The industrylater adopted a voluntary safety standard. Research. The CPSC conducts research on potential product hazards.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1840,CPSC scientists andresearchers look for new or emerging consumerproduct hazards and try to ﬁnd solutions to exist ing product hazards. Since the 1970s the CPSChas operated the National Electronic Injury Sur veillance System NEISS which tracks injuries inU.S. hospital emergency departments and allowsthe commission to make national injury estimates.The NEISS often serves as an early warning systemabout problems with speciﬁc consumer products. Communication Partnerships.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1841,The CPSC communicates with and educates the public byworking with the media state and local govern ments and private organizations and by respond ing to consumer inquiries. The commission alsodevelops cooperative partnerships with businessesand other organizations to create public healthcampaigns on many issues. For example in coop eration with a national baby products company agrassroots program called Baby Safety Showerswas implemented.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1844,Of these APHISand FSIS remain within the USDA while the EPAbecame an independent agency in 1971 and theFDA became an independent agency in 1941 andthen later became part of the Department of HealthEducation and Welfare now the Department ofHealth and Human Services . APHIS regulates plant and animal diseases mainly in order to protect economic interests.Some of the animal diseases however are trans missible to humans including brucellosis undu lant fever and tuberculosis.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1845,APHIS also is chargedwith keeping exotic animal diseases such as footand mouth disease and bovine spongiformencephalopathy BSE or mad cow disease out ofthe United States. Epidemics of both these dis eases among animals in several European coun tries during 2000 and 2001 have caused consider able fear of meat products as well as economicdamage from extensive killing of animals to con trol the epidemics.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1846,Thus far during these out breaks however no cases of either disease havebeen reported in the United States. Success in thisarea has marked APHIS as one of the most effec tive agencies of its kind in the world. FSIS is charged with the inspection of meat poultry and eggs. A particularly large agency ofmore than 9 000 employees FSIS is required bylaw to continuously inspect food animals duringslaughter.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1847,This requirement is somewhat datedand is based on the dubious presumption thatvisual inspection is effective. In order to modernize meat and poultry in spection FSIS published a regulation in 1996 whichhas enabled the agency to employ the HazardAnalysis and Critical Control Point System HACCP as an added and improved safeguard.HACCP is a systems approach to food control thatemphasizes prevention.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1848,First developed for thespace program HACCP is generally recognized asthe most advanced system for ensuring safe food.Integral to the system is the identiﬁcation of haz ards that could contaminate the food and a com prehensive set of veriﬁcation steps and audits thatensure the system has been effective. First adaptedto a regulatory framework by the U.S. govern ment HACCP is now the standard of food inspec tion throughout the world.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1849,The Centers for Dis ease Control CDC has evaluated HACCP and UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY USDOE 1251concluded that it is in fact reducing food borne disease from meat and poultry sources. Egg inspection primarily consists of publish ing standards for storage and temperature cou pled with delegated collaboration with state andlocal ofﬁcials. Egg safety concerns have been height ened by the advent of Salmonella enteritidis in the early 1980s.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1850,This organism found a new niche inthe oviduct of laying chickens. While causing nodisease to the bird by seeding itself in the egg yolkit became a leading cause of salmonellosis in hu mans. Control programs center on eliminating thedisease from breeder and laying ﬂocks as wellas with consumer education programs designedto encourage adequate cooking of eggs. Theseinterdiction programs have materially reduced hu man infection associated with the organism.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1851,FSIS also operates two so called zero toler ance programs for Listeria monocytogenes and for Escherichia coli 0157 H7 . Zero tolerance means that the presence of the organism at any level in asample of ready to eat food is grounds for recall ofthe food from the marketplace. The largest foodrecalls in American history have resulted from thispolicy over the past two years.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1852,The L. monocytogenes program was initiated in 1988 a 1994 evaluationby CDC credited the program with a 25 percentreduction in human Listeriosis. The hemorrhagicE. coli program was implemented in 1994 human enterohemorrhagic E. coli has not particularly de clined but it also has not increased since theinception of the program in the midst of an annu ally progressing incidence. FSIS has overseen a dramatic reduction in chemical contaminants of the meat and poultry supply.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1853,In the late 1970s and early 1980s 10percent or more of these foods were contaminatedwith anabolic steroids antibiotics pesticides orheavy metals. Today the levels of violative resi dues are below 1 percent and in most meat com modities levels are approaching zero. Violativelevels are hazardous concentrations in foods. Theseaccomplishments are due to a risk based samplingprogram followed by sanctions against violators due in part to a productive synergy with FDA sCenter for Veterinary Medicine CVM .

It alsohas a major role in the production of nuclearweapons the safe storage of nuclear wastes andthe remediation of sites that have been contami nated as a result of the nation s atom bomb pro duction program.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1856,DOE has a strong scientiﬁc component located in the DOE National Labora tories which support research ranging from basicbiologic processes to risk assessment. While not a frontline public health agency DOE engages in many activities that impact hu man health and the environment.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1857,These includeits role in the national choice of energy sources such as the different fossil fuels that emit varyinglevels of sulfur oxides particulates and nitrogenoxide air pollutants nuclear energy with its attend ant risks and hydroelectric power sources whichalso have ecological consequences. DOE is alsoheavily involved in research to develop more efﬁ cient and less polluting automobiles.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1858,Within theDOE the Division of Environmental Managementand the Division of Environment Health and Safety have combined annual budgets of over 6 billion which is used to clean up the legacy of atombomb production and to protect worker and com munity health. The secrecy surrounding the atom bomb pro gram and a series of poor decisions on the part ofDOE leadership have at times engendered dis trust of the agency by local communities scientiﬁcgroups and by Congress.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1872,G. T. Kurian. New York Oxford University Press. UNITED STATES PREVENTIVE SERVICES TASK FORCE USPSTF The United States Preventive Services Task Force USPSTF is a group of nongovernmental expertsconvened by the U.S. Department of Health andHuman Services to review published literatureand develop recommendations for the use of clini cal preventive services. The task force are expertschosen for their experience in the evaluation ofclinical evidence and its application to the care ofpatients.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1873,The ﬁrst task force patterned itself on aprevious program in Canada. Its report entitled Guide to Clinical Preventive Services appeared in 1988. The second task force met between 1990and 1995 and published a second edition of theguide in 1996. This second edition contained rec ommendations on 53 screening tests 11 counsel ing interventions 13 immunizations and 6 medi cations to prevent illness. The third task forceconvened in 1998.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1874,The concept of preventing disease probably began in the 1790s with Edward Jenner s cowpoxvaccination against smallpox. The eradication ofsmallpox and the near eradication of polio areamong the triumphs of preventive medicine. Dis ease prevention appropriate in the case of small pox and polio is a misnomer in most cases. Riskreduction is a more apt description of what pre ventive services actually do.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1875,Counseling about seat belt use immunization against inﬂuenza and medi cations to prevent osteoporosis and fractures are examples of preventive services that reduce therisk of illness or injury. Other preventive services exempliﬁed by a screening test detect diseasebefore it can do harm. The goal of breast cancerscreening is to detect cancer before it spreadsbeyond the breast. As with many diseases espe cially cancers early detection improves the chancesfor effective treatment.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1876,A recommendation to provide a preventive service establishes a policy that will apply to every one. Airbags are a good example. All cars havethem yet very few people will have an accident inwhich airbags will function to save their lives. Thissituation is typical of most preventive services Thetarget condition occurs infrequently in healthypeople. Therefore many people are exposed tothe risks of airbags for each person who survives anaccident because of airbags.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1877,This example showsthat a recommendation for a preventive serviceshould have solid evidence that its beneﬁts exceedany harms. This fact is the principal justiﬁcationfor convening experts to evaluate and using asystematic approach to this task. The current United States Preventive Services Task Force exempliﬁes a thorough approach tothe evidence. Once the task force decides to makerecommendations about a topic e.g.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1878,screeningfor diabetes a federally funded university basedgroup of scholars searches the published literature UNITED STATES PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE USPHS 1254for evidence about the effect of the preventive service on health outcomes. The group evaluatesthe evidence picks the best research and summa rizes it in tabular form and in an evidence report.The task force meets four times a year to decide onthe quality of the evidence and to formulate arecommendation.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1879,These recommendations varyin their conviction depending on the strength ofthe evidence. Before making a recommendation the task force considers two features of the evidence. First is the evidence valid In other words does thepreventive service really do what the evidenceseems to say To form this judgment the task forcemust be sure that the preventive service e.g.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1880,lowering serum cholesterol rather than other fac tors such as a healthy lifestyle is responsible for areduction in the frequency of a disease such ascoronary heart disease. Second how large is theeffect of the preventive service If the evidence isstrong and the preventive service has a large healtheffect the task force will make a strongly favorablerecommendation.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1881,Otherwise the task force mayrecommend against doing the preventive service or it may simply say that the evidence is too weak tomake a recommendation for or against the preven tive service. The task force publishes supporting evidence to justify each of its recommendations.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1882,Each publi cation consists of a description of the burden ofsuffering from the target condition the effect ofthe preventive service on the risk of the targetcondition recommendations of other organiza tions and a discussion of special aspects of theevidence. Each publication begins with a concisedescription of the recommendation and a sum mary rating of the strength of the evidence andends with a description of the clinical interventionthat physicians would provide.

The PHS administers hundreds of grant in aid programs ranging from grants to support basiclaboratory research by investigators in universitydepartments to block grants to states for supportof maternal and child health services.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1888,Many ofthese grant in aid programs have a very narrowfocus specifying in some detail the action thatmust be taken by grantees e.g. a state agency while other grants e.g. the Prevention block grant permit greater leeway by the grantees.

Article I Sec tion 8 of the U.S. Constitution is the original legalbasis for the federal government s responsibilityto provide health services to American Indiansand Alaskan Natives.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1909,The structure of the IHS hasbeen shaped by numerous treaties laws SupremeCourt decisions and executive orders since theratiﬁcation of the Constitution. The goals of theIHS have been to ensure that comprehensive culturally acceptable personal and public healthservices are available and accessible to all Ameri can Indian and Alaskan Native people. Because oflimited resources the hospitals clinics and publichealth programs of the IHS primarily serve Indianreservations and Eskimo villages.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1910,Currently morethan half of all American Indians do not reside onreservations and are not eligible for these directservices provided by IHS. In recent years the IHSworked closely with tribes to transfer programmanagement to the tribes. Limited funding byCongress has slowed this process.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1931,Opportunities to workwith others who share a concern increases the likelihood of identifying appropriate actions and generating political support for solutions. Over time the population of the world has become much more urban.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1932,In 1900 39.6 percent URBAN HEALTH 1259of the United States population was deﬁned as urban by the Bureau of the Census by 1990 theproportion considered urban was 75.2 percent.The deﬁnition of urban as used however does notinclude solely the densely populated centers suchas Chicago or New York City. The Census Bureauconsiders any area with over 2 500 population tobe urban this is a population center many peo ple are more likely to call a village or hamlet than acity.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1933,The deﬁnition more consistent with the com mon concept of an urban area includes communi ties of 100 000 or more with a nucleus of at least50 000 and surrounding communities that share ahigh degree of social and economic integration.By this deﬁnition only the 276 major metropoli tan areas of the United States are considered urban. Social cohesion and social breakdown are the two ends of a spectrum describing the relationshippeople in a given setting experience.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1934,The greaterthe cohesion the more likely the group is to worktogether to share common values and to ﬁndpositive solutions to problems in ways that areinclusive of all members of the group. Conversely when social breakdown has occurred individualsare left to struggle with the challenges of livingalone people turn on one another in ways that aredamaging and problems accumulate to a levelincompatible with a healthy life.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1935,Urban areas oftoday have within them neighborhoods that couldbe described as fully cohesive but far too manyurban areas are at or are closer to the other endof the spectrum. AREAS OF CONCERN The issue of urbanization is not just one of larger numbers of persons gathered into urban geopoliti cal units. The geographic size of a city makes adifference as well.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1936,For example in central NewYork City Manhattan there are 52 419 peopleper square mile in Cook County Illinois Chi cago 5 398 in Los Angeles County California 2 183 and in Dade County Florida Miami 996.1.In contrast the overall United States populationdensity is 70.3 people per square mile and in 1790the nation had a population density of 4.5 peopleper square mile.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1937,The less concentrated populationof today s sprawling urban areas present chal lenges of a different kind such as the difﬁculties oforganizing public transportation. Lack of masstransportation may mean increased pollution fromindividual use of internal combustion engines and it may mean that individuals lacking a per sonal car may have difﬁculty reaching healthservices.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1938,From an economic perspective urban popula tions experience some of the extremes of incomeinequality with large differences in income be tween the highest and lowest earning segments ofthe population. Income inequality has been in creasing in the United States over the last twenty ﬁve years and for the low earning segment canhave a signiﬁcant negative impact on health.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1939,Areaswith high income inequality and a low averageincome have been reported as experiencing nearly140 deaths per 100 000 people compared with arate of 64.7 per 100 000 in other areas. This impactis greater for infants and those between 15 and 64years of age. A study of thirty large metropolitanareas revealed that when poverty is concentratedwithin a geographic area mortality is signiﬁcantlyelevated. Conversely a concentration of afﬂuenceis associated with lower mortality at least in theelderly.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1940,Urban populations in the United States in clude large ethnic and racial minority populations.The combination of segregation and discrimina tion felt by minority groups in urban areas can alsohave an impact on health whether due to limita tions in access to health services education andjobs or the increase in stress due to the tensions ofbeing a minority population. Urban areas havebeen cited often for example for the failure oftheir police forces to respond equitably to mem bers of minority populations.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1941,This has includeddisproportionate targeting of minorities as poten tial offenders racial proﬁling a lower level ofresponse to complaints or requests for assistance or outright disrespect or brutality. While none ofthese issues is uniquely urban the concentrationof population and the media visibility in a metro politan area make this an even greater issue ofconcern. As already identiﬁed placing a large number of people in a small area increases the risk ofhealth and illness problems.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1943,The high population density and the use of large poorlyventilated spaces as overnight sleeping accommo dations for the homeless provided an ideal envi ronment for the transmission of the bacillus. Thefact that the public health resources were beingstrained by the arrival of another condition HIV AIDS human immunodeﬁciency virus acquiredimmunodeﬁciency syndrome compounded theproblem and meant that drug resistant organismswere being shared.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1944,Health concerns as much asconcerns for recreation space have been involvedin the development of at least limited open spacessuch as parks within concentrated urban areas. The interrelationships of central urban areas to their surrounding suburbs has been the focus of study and attention from several perspectives. Thedecreased population density of suburban hous ing may mitigate some problems that are encoun tered in older urban settings.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1945,For example theremay be more open spaces for recreation or sport and access to more remote areas is simpler. On theother hand suburbs mean more widely dispersedindividual homes each needing access to utilitiesand transportation and constructed in such a waythat neighborhood cohesion may be difﬁcult orimpossible to develop. The availability of individ ual automobile transport in the United States hasundoubtedly contributed to suburban sprawl ashave issues of social discrimination.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1946,These areashave also grown because of what has been labeled urban ﬂight the movement out of cities of themore afﬂuent as new waves of immigrants oftenfrom different ethnic or racial groups moved in.The apparent cost of maintaining or advancing astandard of living within the urban core was seenas too great. This ﬂight however leaves olderhousing stock to be occupied by those of lowerincome levels with less generation of taxes tosupport services and the beginning of a down ward spiral.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1947,When combined with the movementof industry because of restrictions on pollution search for a cheaper labor pool or simple displace ment due to competition from elsewhere theresult can be a severe area wide depression. Thecities of the so called Rust Belt of the northeasternUnited States provide many vivid examples ofthis cycle. Some of the health concerns in urban areas are the result of a loss of individual control.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1948,Whena person is dependent on either walking or using aprivate vehicle on a seldom used two lane road there is much less need to be concerned about thebehavior of others than if the person uses public transportation or walks or drives in a busy urban environment. In addition to the difﬁculties relatedto the increased numbers of encounters there isan increased level of stress which is known toincrease the risk of illness.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1949,The density of urbanpopulations and the associated stresses have alsobeen associated with increased rates of violenceand in the second half of the twentieth century anincrease in crime associated with an increase in thedistribution sale and use of illegal drugs. Some ofthe crime directly involved the drug distributionnetworks as they competed with one another forturf other crimes were committed by those whobecame addicted as they attempted to ﬁnd theresources to support their addictions.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1950,For exam ple one occupational risk that has been studied is the risk of violence to convenience store employ ees. Of 1 835 robberies of convenience stores ineastern metropolitan areas in 1992 and 1993 63percent involved the use of a ﬁrearm and 12percent were associated with an injury to at leastone employee. All ﬁve reported fatalities wereﬁrearm related. A major news story of the late twentieth cen tury was the dramatic success of many urban areasin reducing violent crime.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1951,While observers areconsistent in saying that no single action can becredited with bringing this about it may have beenthe result of a combination of much more sophisti cated and targeted policing and a demographicshift that meant a smaller population of youngadults the group most likely to be involved in crime. Finally cities are a center of immigration both from rural areas as evidenced by the popula tion shift of the last century and from othercountries.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1952,Port cities which may not be coastal inthis age of airport travel experience a constantinﬂux of people from other cultures and climates.This may add to the health challenge in a numberof ways. For example during the period followingthe end of the Vietnam War in which a largenumber of refugees from Southeast Asia werearriving in the United States many health careproviders had to learn about an entirely new rangeof parasitic diseases that were endemic in thesepeople s countries of origin.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1953,Beyond speciﬁc dis eases immigrants bring different expectations of URBAN HEALTH 1261the health care system and a different understand ing of the range of interventions appropriate tovarious disease states. Some immigrant health prac tices have moved toward the mainstream as in theincreasing use of acupuncture once seen as anodd practice of the Chinese immigrant commu nity. And the increasingly popular herbal reme dies are an echo of the role the botanica plays in Hispanic cultures.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1954,HOUSING Assurance of safe housing has long been an issue for urban areas and the history of the city is one ofmany cycles of housing development and reform.Failure to plan for housing infrastructure waterand sewer systems electricity when the popula tion is moving into an urban area can result inextensive substandard housing for those at lowerincome levels. This can be found in the barrios favelas and other overnight city extensions found around many cities in the developing world.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1955,In theUnited States few such areas are visible thoughthey are reported to be growing around citiesalong the Mexican border . Substandard urbanhousing more often takes the form of older build ings in central city neighborhoods that have notbeen maintained and are not well served by publicor private services of any kind. Health hazards insuch settings include exposure to lead based paint cockroach feces implicated in the increase inasthma temperature extremes or unsafe win dows and stairs.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1956,In addition to issues of inadequate housing the combination of a limited supply of affordablehousing and low income levels leaves some indi viduals and families with no place to call home.The homeless concentrate in urban areas. Thismay be in part due to the cost of housing in someurban areas forcing people out of safe housingand into the streets.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1957,For example the economicboom of the 1990s in New York City led to atightened housing market those serving the home less reported a marked increase in families withchildren ﬁnding themselves without a permanentplace to live. This has important implications forhealth care as homelessness may be associatedwith a lack of a way to pay for care and the strugglefor safe shelter may obscure early indications ofneed for care and thus more serious illness prob lems later on.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1958,Housing policy that does not offerready assistance may also consider a person as having a home as long as there is some extendedfamily member with room on the sofa or livingroom ﬂoor. While such an arrangement may workfor a short time under emergency circumstances the loss of privacy and crowding that results adds another dimension of stress to the risks of mentaland physical ill health. The investment of public funds in housing has met with mixed success.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1959,In some cities the hous ing provided was poorly matched to the prefer ences and needs of the people who would be livingthere and then allowed to deteriorate to the pointthat destruction was the only viable option. Theimplosion of the Pruitt Igoe Houses in St. Louis Missouri in the 1970s was the ﬁrst widely publi cized destruction many others followed.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1960,Othersubstandard housing has been removed under theguise of urban renewal but has not always beenreplaced with appropriately affordable housing.The process of improving housing stock has oftenled to increases in cost attracting a more afﬂuentgroup. This gentriﬁcation leaves those at the lowerend of the income scale still at risk and withoutsuitable housing.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1961,Current public policy in theUnited States directed by the Department of Hous ing and Urban Development is focused on devel oping tenants as managers of public housing pro jects under the theory that this will increase thelikelihood that the property will not be allowed todeteriorate and that those involved in the manage ment process will be learning new skills and im proving their place in the general job market.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1962,Another approach to insuring that the entire urban population has safe housing is throughsubsidies vouchers that underwrite a portion ofthe rent in the general housing market. Landlordsare encouraged to participate in the programthrough tax incentives. News reports have oftenmade much of this program and of the fact that itmay be associated with the integration of racial orethnic groups that do not typically share neighbor hoods.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1963,Some neighborhoods have been reportedto be extremely resistant and even hostile to thisapproach others have been welcoming and foundit an enriching experience. As would be true in rural as well as urban areas control of indoor temperature is a signiﬁ cant issue.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1964,Experiences during periods of extremeheat during the 1990s have led to an increasing URBAN HEALTH 1262awareness of the risks especially for the elderly or inﬁrm in urban areas when the temperature re mains over 95 or 100 degrees Fahrenheit for sev eral days. Windows may be locked shut for fear ofintruders and fans or air conditioning may be seenas an expensive luxury.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1965,Neighborhoods attentiveto the needs of the housebound during a severewinter are they frozen in without adequate food have we made adjustments in the cost of heating sothat freezing is unlikely have not understood thatthere were perils at the other end of the ther mometer.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1966,In areas in which housing is multilevel and especially where it is high rise the isolation ofindividuals may mean that neighbors do not knowwho is alone and unable to make appropriateadjustments to either hot or cool weather andexcess media attention to crime and violence maydistort views of personal safety and mitigate againstcooperation. FOOD AND WATER Urban areas offer inhabitants little opportunity to obtain food other than through purchase.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1967,Thelarger the urbanized area the further foods haveto travel to reach stores and eventually house holds. This also makes fresh a relative term theproduce delivered straight from the ﬁeld to thestore is going to be much fresher when the journeyis one hour than when it is one day. On the otherhand large concentrations of people make it eco nomically reasonable to regularly import foodfrom all over the globe making formerly seasonalfruits and vegetables available year round.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1968,The issue of food availability in urban areas differentiates by income level as does every otheraspect of urban life and health. The cost of space inurban areas makes it less likely that large modernsupermarkets with volume pricing will be avail able instead food is purchased from small neigh borhood shops usually at higher prices. Further in areas in which many live in smaller spaces apartments and multiple occupancy buildings ofall kinds there may be less space to store lessexpensive bulk items.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1969,The combined impact ofthese factors is that the quality and quantity offood available to lower income families in urbanareas means they will suffer nutritionally. Some urban areas have made vacant space available for neighborhood gardens in which bothproduce and decorative plants may be grown.During periods of population decline or urban renewal the destruction of buildings makes lotsavailable and it may be good policy to encourageneighborhood use of the space for gardening.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1970,Thereturn of economic development however mayalso abruptly make the land far more valuable as aspace for building leaving the gardeners bereft ofland. The issue is not just that of the food pro duced which represents only a small proportion of need but the beneﬁts of open space and posi tive activities.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1971,Delivery of fresh water to residents was often one of the ﬁrst public health activities taken up bymunicipal authorities in the eighteenth century.Using simple surface impoundment wooden pip ing and gravity water that was not contaminatedby urban sewerage and waste products could bemade available to central pumps and to individualresidences.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1972,Over time the systems have becomemore elaborate and contamination concerns haveexpanded to include not only the infectious dis eases of the past and present but a wide range ofpotentially damaging chemical agents associatedwith modern industrial life. The EnvironmentalProtection Agency devotes a substantial propor tion of its budget and energy to both the protec tion of water in its natural state through theprovisions of the Clean Water Act of 1977 and theassurance that drinking water is safe.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1973,The capacityof modern laboratories to measure the presenceof material in water at a level of very few parts perbillion has led to extensive debates about the levelof purity that is achievable and reasonable.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1974,What ever the outcome of these differences it is veryclear from mortality and morbidity ﬁgures thatwaterborne diseases in the United States are sig niﬁcantly fewer now than they were a century ago.Water systems need regular maintenance how ever and main pipes installed decades ago remaina regular rupture hazard in older urban areas. For urban areas concern about water is not only related to use for human consumption it is asigniﬁcant part of safety given the role that waterplays in control of ﬁre.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1975,The concentration of hous ing and industry in urban areas has made ﬁre safety an urban concern since the colonial era. Benjamin Franklin is cited as the father of themodern ﬁre insurance and ﬁre ﬁghting systems inthe United States. Urban areas devote an extensiveportion of zoning and construction regulation toassuring that heating cooking and industrial ﬁres URBAN HEALTH 1263and electrical transmission systems are such that the probability of ﬁre is minimized.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1976,For example every building over six stories high in New YorkCity must be equipped with a rooftop water stor age tank assuring a volume and pressure of wateradequate for ﬁre suppression should one occur.Municipalities have also led the way in the develop ment of professional ﬁre departments with in creasingly sophisticated training and equipment.In some communities ﬁre department personnelare involved not only in ﬁre safety education as acommunity service but they are active in healthpromotion e.g.

WASTE DISPOSAL The concentration of populations in urban areas also means an increased accumulation of wasteproducts.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1979,Removal of human waste and garbage isa major commitment in any city whether themechanism chosen is completely public or fundedby a mixture of public and private resources. The treatment of human waste is costly and new re quirements that protect both people and the envi ronment from contaminants has meant a steadyinvestment in upgrading treatment facilities andbuilding new ones.

While many areas do not want any waste disposal nearby the acceptanceand processing of urban waste has been welcomed by some economically suffering rural areas. Trashfrom East Coast urban areas may be moved longdistances by land or sea for ﬁnal disposal. Thevolume of waste is directly related to the degree ofattention paid to recycling of materials.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1982,Paper glass metal and plastics all can be returned to usewith proper treatment but efforts to fully recyclemet with varying degrees of success. Some urbanareas have come very late to full recycling efforts but most now offer curbside or individual pickupof separated recyclable materials.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1983,At the same time as communities search for more ways to dispose of waste attention to thesiting of waste disposal has increased due to theawareness that racial and ethnic minorities havefound themselves disproportionately exposed tothese sites.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,1985,This issueof environmental justice could be easily expandedto other land use issues in urban areas since neigh borhoods with lower income levels and greaterconcentrations of minority populations generallyhave less open space for parks and playing ﬁelds and the ones they have are often in poor condi tion. Lack of safe park space leaves low incomeurban children playing in the street or other un safe areas increasing chances of injury. Both air and noise pollution are of great con cern in urban areas.

URBAN SOCIAL DISPARITIES It is a truism of epidemiology that disease is not uniformly distributed across society that somesocial groups or geographical areas experiencehigher disease rates while other social groups orareas experience lower disease rates.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2006,Thus someepidemiologists have investigated the relationshipbetween social class or socioeconomic positionand health or disease. These studies show thatdisease and mortality rates are higher in thoseurban areas or social classes where the incumbentsare the least educated and where household in come is lowest jobs are insecure and where thereis little wealth or political power.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2007,Similarly diseaseand mortality rates are lower in those areas andsocial classes where the incumbents are the mosteducated and where household income is highest jobs are secure and where wealth and politicalpower are concentrated.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2008,SOCIAL CLASS DEFINED Richard Scase following the trail blazed by Karl Marx writes that social classes in the industrial eraare inherent to capitalism that differential con trol over the means of production factories res taurants computers software systems producesdifferent social classes. Thus the concept of class is important for understanding urban or rural social disparities in health and disease in capitalistsocieties.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2009,Dennis Gilbert following both Karl Marxand Max Weber deﬁnes a social class as a largegroup of families or households that are approxi mately equal in rank to each other but clearlydifferentiated from other families along the di mensions of occupational autonomy and security education income wealth and political power.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2010,Gilbert in 1998 maintained that six classes adequately describe the American class structure URBAN SOCIAL DISPARITIES 1266a capitalist class 1 of households an upper middle class 14 a middle class 30 a work ing or lower middle class 30 the workingpoor 13 and an underclass 12 . Capitalist households are composed of investors heirs and executives theirincomes average around 1.5 millionper year in 1995 and their mainsource of income is property stocks orother investments.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2011,Capitalists to be usu ally graduate from selective universities. Upper middle class households are com posed of upper managers professionals and medium sized business owners theirincomes average 80 000 per year andtheir main source of income is fromone or two salaries. Upper middle classprofessionals often have postgraduatecredentials.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2012,Middle class households are composed of lower managers semi professionals andnonretail sales workers their incomesaverage 45 000 per year and somemiddle class incumbents may not becollege graduates. Lower middle class households are com posed of operatives low paid craftsmen clerical workers and retail sales work ers their incomes average 30 000 peryear and they are typically high schoolgraduates.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2013,Working poor households are composed of service workers laborers low paidoperatives and clerical workers incomesaverage 20 000 and many incumbentsare not high school graduates. Underclass households are composed of unemployed or part time workers manyincumbents depend on government as sistance their incomes average 10 000per year and many are not high schoolgraduates.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2014,Because wealth job autonomy and security and political power are hard to measure epide miologists have generally relied upon occupation income or education to characterize the classposition of the people in their studies. However relying on education or occupation as the onlymeasure of social class may underestimate the truerelationship between social class and disease.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2015,Socialepidemiologists also argue that more attentionshould be paid to measuring the socioeconomiccharacteristics of neighborhoods and communi ties where people live. The reasoning behind thisassertion is the hypothesis that the social environ ment absence of safe parks for walking or exer cise for example may have additional impacts onhealth that would be missed if the focus of meas urement were household characteristics exclusively.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2016,HOW SOCIAL CLASS AFFECTS HEALTH The social class distribution in a community or urban area appears to affect both the general levelof health as well as speciﬁc disease rates through avariety of mechanisms. One hypothesis is that thegeneral susceptibility to disease is higher in thedisadvantaged classes because of chronic expo sure to stressful life events. The presumed biologi cal mechanisms involve several aspects of theneuroendocrine system that adversely impact hostresistance.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2017,Another hypothesis is that social classaffects life chances from birth through old age that is disadvantaged circumstances early in lifecan set the stage for late onset chronic disease.Starting tobacco smoking and engaging in seden tary behaviors as a teenager from a disadvantagedlower middle class household followed by the de velopment of ischemic heart disease in middleage would be an example of this life course phe nomenon.

Road runoff of automobile oilsand battery metals and road salt also contribute towater pollution and may affect public health. Other Impacts of Increased Auto Usage.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2025,With increased mileage higher speeds and fewer side walks pedestrian accidents have increased espe cially among children and elderly comprising some13 percent of trafﬁc accident fatalities in 1997 and1998. Remarkably 59 percent of pedestrian deathsoccurred where there was no access to crosswalks that is in typical sprawl roadways. A related factorwas the higher speeds prevalent in suburban vs.urban roads since speed and fatality are highlycorrelated.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2026,If states were willing to spend highwayfunds on pedestrian safety there are many short term measures e.g. trafﬁc calming more cross walks that could be taken but at some point slowing of trafﬁc will encounter public resistance.Another impact in typical sprawl development isthe loss of easy access of the elderly to medicalcare social services and shopping once they stopdriving since mass transit is not generally avail able.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2027,This problem is bound to become moresevere as the elderly begin to comprise some 20 to25 percent of our population by 2050. INDIRECT EFFECTS OF SPRAWL ON PUBLIC HEALTH A few examples illustrate that there are also some indirect impacts of urban sprawl on public health. Duplication of Medical Infrastructure.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2033,Urban transport for people hascome to be dominated by the car in the twentiethcentury and trucks have increasingly displacedtrains for the movement of goods while publictransport biking and walking are less frequentlyused alternatives especially in North America. The 1990 census in Canada found that 73 percentof working Canadians drove their own vehicle towork while 10 percent used public transport 7percent walked and 1 percent bicycled.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2034,On aver age North Americans now spend 5 percent oftheir time in motor vehicles. Urban sprawl has made the ownership and use of at least one car almost essential for suburbanresidents. Such low density urban sprawl makespublic transport uneconomical and results in highvehicle miles high fossil fuel consumption andhigh levels of air pollution and emissions of carbondioxide the main greenhouse gas see Figure 1 which shows energy use compared to urban den sity for many world cities .

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2062,One common deﬁnition ofvalues is that they are notions or ideas upon whichwe place worth. Values are inﬂuenced by culturalbackground gender religious afﬁliation and mem bership in social groups. Values therefore becomeinternalized and affect motivation thoughts andbehavior.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2066,Two pairs of contrasting values are signiﬁcant for this discussion contentment versus attainment and pleasure versus self fulﬁllment and growth.Contentment can be accomplished by a reductionof desires. The satisfaction received from onedesire will lead to more desires which can lead todiscontent if the desires are not attained. On theother hand attainment of speciﬁc objects or goalsmay lead to a better or healthier life.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2067,Focusing on VALUES IN HEALTH EDUCATION 1274achieving pleasure such as physical or emotional pleasure is often given precedent over achievingself fulﬁllment and growth which relies more oninternal self evaluation processes. However whenthe latter occurs new goals or the restructuring ofpreviously developed goals results.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2068,When healthis considered in light of the above information thefollowing observations can be made 1 attaining alife that is rich in variety and activities may beconsidered healthy and 2 one s experiences ofpoor health either having poor health oneself orbeing exposed to other s experiences of poor health can be the stimulus to evaluate how one attainsself fulﬁllment through the creation of more ap propriate goals.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2069,Values that affect health also affect health education and health promotion on two levels the individual level and the societal level. At theindividual level values determine whether certainhealth behaviors are acceptable whether the indi vidual will engage in them and whether health education and health promotion programs are ac ceptable. As already stated once values are estab lished they need to be acted upon through deci sions that are made by the individual.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2070,Returning tothe example of the adolescent conﬂicted oversmoking while prioritizing values may lead anindividual to choose not to smoke exposure to avariety of health messages through the media orthrough the school environment may also inﬂu ence this decision. The adolescent may have cometo value having a physically ﬁt and healthy bodyand decided to engage in healthful behaviors. Indoing so this individual will have undergone self evaluation and created goals for speciﬁc healthbehaviors.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2071,When health education and health promotion programs are being developed the audience svalues need to be considered. This will affect among other things what topics are included the way in which the topics are presented andwhether both genders or certain age groups willbe included in the planning and delivery phases.Consider a health education project that was con ducted with a Hutterite colony. This religioussect lives a communal agrarian lifestyle separatefrom mainstream society.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2072,An assessment of healthissues within the colony generated informationabout their values and how these inﬂuenced theirlifestyle and behaviors. Based upon this infor mation health education sessions were plannedand implemented regarding the handling of life threatening emergencies. Because Hutterites valueself sustaining behaviors such as farming over aca demic learning the colony members do not com plete high school.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2073,Therefore when the sessionswere planned handouts were prepared in easilyunderstood terms with numerous diagrams to il lustrate the points. The colony is governed throughan internal system that includes several men withinkey positions. These individuals were consultedwhen planning the health education sessions toensure their acceptance.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2074,Research that focuses onhealth assessments can be conducted in a mannerthat links the ﬁndings to the individual s values thereby ensuring that new or reﬁned health education and health promotion resources are ap propriately determined. At the societal level values make a signiﬁcant contribution to public health.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2075,Two basic values inpublic health are cooperation and collaboration.Health care systems in most countries regardlessof whether or not they are based upon the princi ples of universal accessibility or affordability fo cus upon an illness care system. Illness care is onlydirected at those experiencing ill health eitheracute or chronic.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2076,This is an expensive system tomaintain forcing the numerous caregiving agen cies in countries with a large private sector tocompete for clients for ﬁnancial reimbursementrather than collaborate with other agencies inproviding care. Even in countries with a publiclyfunded health system there is competition foradequate resources to maintain both an illness care and a wellness care system. Wellness care isfocused on healthy individuals to assist them inmaintaining or improving their health.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2077,Not sur prisingly regardless of what system is available illness care is given the priority. Hence althoughhealth education and health promotion programsexist they are not always given a high prioritywithin health agencies. The public at large also hasdifﬁculty in creating a societal value which empha sizes wellness care for several reasons. First ill ness care is more visible through the presence ofacute health facilities and the media attentiongiven to medical breakthroughs.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2078,Second the lackof extensive and prolonged exposure to a varietyof health education and health promotion pro grams lessens the overall beneﬁts and the integra tion of such programs into the public s everydaylives. Despite these limitations such programs VDRL TEST 1275have the potential to inﬂuence and alter individual and societal values and subsequent behaviors ifthey are appropriately delivered.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2079,One example isthe public acceptance of the use of seat belts apractice which has become commonplace due tothe implementation of various health educationprograms and strategies as well as the public sprioritization of values related to health and safety. More recent discussions of values and their impact on health have called into question themanner in which health education and healthpromotion is being delivered.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2080,In an issue of Social Science Medicine in 1998 Olav Forde discussed at length the emphasis on achieving a lifestyle that isfree of risk. Forde wrote that life has becomemedicalized due in part to an increase in healthand risk awareness which stems from the mediaconcentration on diseases that capture the public sattention and concern.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2081,Such attention is enhancedby health professionals who encourage the contin ual ﬂow of health information to the public whilecontinuing to base their interventions on people sfear of disease and obsession with health. Thus engaging in a healthy lifestyle and in certain be haviors becomes parallel to avoiding risk. Themore crucial concern is the link between the un necessary emphasis on the prevention of risk andthe inappropriate change in societal values in rela tion to health.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2082,Consequently healthism is becom ing the principal life value. Values such as toler ance and nonconformity are questioned whenthere is such emphasis on avoiding risk becausethere is an expectation that everyone will act in amanner that will lower individual risk and ulti mately the public s risk. A shift such as this canlead individuals to experience guilt blame andintolerance if they do not adhere to such valuesand behaviors.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2083,Diversity of thoughts and actionis less acceptable because conformity becomesthe expectation. Health education and health promotion workers unconsciously or not incor porate these attitudes in their work with individu als and communities further contributing to thisshift in values. Values are constantly being altered according to the changing context within which they arelocated. It has been suggested that values for thetwenty ﬁrst century will be empowering caring and cooperating.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2084,Such changes will likely be de bated and examined to ensure that the relation ships between values and health education andhealth promotion are sound ones and that they can lead to health behaviors that will result in anoptimal level of health for the public.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2091,VECTOR BORNE DISEASES From the perspective of infectious diseases vec tors are the transmitters of disease causing organ isms that carry the pathogens from one host toanother. By common usage vectors are consid ered to be invertebrate animals usually arthropods.Technically however vertebrates can also act asvectors including foxes raccoons and skunks which can all transmit the rabies virus to humans via a bite.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2092,Arthropods account for over 85 percentof all known animal species and they are the mostimportant disease vectors. Arthropods may affecthuman health either directly by bites stings orinfestation of tissues or indirectly through diseasetransmission. Several genera of arthropods play arole in human disease but mosquitoes and ticksare the most notable disease vectors. The mostsigniﬁcant mode of vector borne disease transmis sion is by biological transmission by blood feedingarthropods.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2093,The pathogen multiplies within thearthropod vector and the pathogen is transmittedwhen the arthropod takes a blood meal. Mechani cal transmission of disease agents may also occurwhen arthropods physically carry pathogens fromone place or host to another usually on body parts. The transmission of vector borne diseases to humans depends on three different factors thepathologic agent the arthropod vector and thehuman host see Figure 1 .
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2094,The majority of vector borne diseases survive in nature by utilizing animals as their vertebratehosts and are therefore zoonoses. For a smallnumber of zoonoses such as malaria and dengue humans are the major host with no signiﬁcantanimal reservoirs. Intermediary animal hosts of ten serve as a reservoir for the pathogens untilsusceptible human populations are exposed. Thevector receives the pathogen from an infected hostand transmits it either to an intermediary host ordirectly to the human host.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2095,The different stages ofthe pathogen s life cycle occur during this processand are intimately dependent upon the availabilityof suitable vectors and hosts.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2096,Key components thatdetermine the occurrence of vector borne diseasesinclude 1 the abundance of vectors and interme diate and reservoir hosts 2 the prevalence ofdisease causing pathogens suitably adapted to thevectors and the human or animal host 3 the localenvironmental conditions especially temperatureand humidity and 4 the resilience behavior andimmune status of the human population.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2097,Vector borne diseases are prevalent in the tropics and subtropics and are relatively rare intemperate zones although climate change couldcreate conditions suitable for outbreaks of dis eases such as Lyme disease Rocky Mountain spot ted fever malaria dengue fever and viral en cephalitis in temperate regions. There are different VECTOR BORNE DISEASES 1277patterns of vector borne disease occurrence.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2098,Para sitic and bacterial diseases such as malaria andLyme disease tend to produce a high diseaseincidence but do not cause major epidemics. Anexception to this rule is plague a bacterial diseasethat does cause outbreaks. In contrast many vec tor viral diseases such as Yellow fever dengue and Japanese encephalitis commonly cause majorepidemics.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2099,There has been a worldwide resurgence of vector borne diseases since the 1970s includingmalaria dengue Yellow fever louse borne typhus plague leishmaniasis sleeping sickness West Nileencephalitis Lyme disease Japanese encephalitis Rift Valley fever and Crimean Congo hemorrhagicfever.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2100,Reasons for the emergence or resurgence ofvector borne diseases include the development ofinsecticide and drug resistance decreased resourcesfor surveillance prevention and control of vector borne diseases deterioration of the public healthinfrastructure required to deal with these diseases unprecedented population growth uncontrolledurbanization changes in agricultural practices deforestation and increased travel. Changes havebeen documented in the distribution of importantarthropod disease vectors.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2102,Control measures for vector borne diseases are important because most are zoonoses that aremaintained in nature in cycles involving wild ani mals and are not amenable to eradication. There fore control methods generally focus on targetingthe arthropod vector. These include undertakingpersonal protective measures by establishing physi cal barriers such as house screens and bed nets wearing appropriate clothing boots apparel that overlap the upper garments head nets etc. and using insect repellents.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2103,Environmental modiﬁca tion to eliminate speciﬁc breeding areas or chemi cal biological control measures to kill arthropodlarvae or adults may also be undertaken.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2110,The contribution of veterinary science to hu man health has been fundamental and sustainedover millennia. It is not generally appreciated that this contribution pertains not only to livestock andfood production animal power and transporta tion which have laid the basis for most urbansocieties around the world.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2111,The study and manage ment of animal diseases have also laid the basis formuch of what is known about the dynamics andmanagement of infectious human diseases andhas aided in the promotion of environmentalquality. Calvin Schwabe one of the most important ﬁgures in veterinary public health in the twentiethcentury has traced and documented the roots ofthe healing professions to healer priests in theNile Valley.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2112,Because cattle and horses were soimportant for sustainable food supplies trans port and the military cohesion of ancient empires these animals were very carefully observed andhusbanded. In addition the integrative view ofhealers in Egyptian and Greek cultures allowedlessons of comparative anatomy and diseaseslearned from the slaughter hunting and sacriﬁceof animals to be applied readily to the healing ofprimates.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2113,Even today both human and veterinarymedical practice draw upon the same pool of comparative multispecies biomedical research. RELATIONSHIPS TO PUBLIC HEALTH If we narrow the focus of veterinary public health to those aspects that are directly pertinent to the practice of public health rather than to humanhealth in general three broad areas of involve ment become clear.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2114,Although these are sometimescharacterized in historical terms or in terms of rich country poor country divisions these differ ent facets of veterinary public health are in factongoing in complementary and often synergisticfashion in most parts of the world.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2115,Veterinary public health in the ﬁrst place grows from its relationship to food production usually by investigating and controlling animaldiseases that threaten either food supplies or ani mal transportation and labor which are essentialelements in food production throughout much ofthe world.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2116,A second facet of veterinary publichealth relates to control of the transmission ofzoonotic diseases either directly or through foods.This is reﬂected in a wide array of activities includ ing research and control of infectious agents inmeat and milk rabies vaccination campaigns bothof wildlife and domestic animals monitoringarboviruses and Lyme borreliosis in populationsin wildlife and hydatid disease control programs. These ﬁrst two facets are widely recognized as veterinary public health activities.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2117,The third facet however is less widely known. In many parts of theworld veterinarians because of their knowledgeof animal diseases as well as the ecological eco nomic and human cultural contexts of these dis eases have been instrumental in developing andimplementing new methods of promoting sus tainable public health that are ecosystemicallygrounded culturally feasible and economicallyrealistic.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2118,Many veterinary public health activities are reﬂected in the nature of veterinary involvementin public health institutions in North America andEurope. Veterinary activities involving disease con trol and health management in animal popula tions and their integration of clinical pathologi cal and epidemiological practices often precededsimilar activities in human medicine by decades or in some cases centuries.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2119,It was in the area of VETERINARY PUBLIC HEALTH 1279food hygiene however that veterinary contribu tions to public health were ﬁrst formally institu tionalized. In Europe particularly in Germany veterinarians in the nineteenth and twentieth cen turies were integral to the development of foodhygiene laws and meat inspection systems initiallyto curb large outbreaks of trichinosis.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2120,In the aftermath of World War II the U.S. Public Health Service s Communicable DiseaseCenter later named the Centers for Disease Con trol and Prevention CDC established a veterinarypublic health unit. James Steele the ﬁrst chiefpublic health veterinarian in the CDC was alsoactive in promoting the veterinary public healthunit in the World Health Organization. Martin Kaplan another American veterinarian became the ﬁrst director of this unit.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2121,Both men expandedthe traditional European emphasis on veterinary directed food safety programs to include investi gations into the epidemiology and control ofzoonoses. The 1960s and 1970s saw a reducedinterest in veterinary public health particularly inNorth America because major infectious diseaseswere thought to be under control and publichealth epidemiologists focused their efforts largelyon chronic diseases such as heart disease andcancer.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2122,Although veterinarians were deeply in volved in improving the understanding of theseconditions by studying them in animal popula tions many scientists and laypeople still had animage of veterinary public health practitioners asmeat inspectors in a slaughterhouse. In 1975 theveterinary public health unit within the CDC wasofﬁcially disbanded.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2123,Even during this time how ever several veterinarians were making strongcontributions to public health through the CDC.Joe Held a graduate of the Epidemic IntelligenceService of CDC went on to become director of theNational Institutes of Health Division of ResearchServices Assistant Surgeon General and directorof the Pan American Zoonoses Center in Argentina. Some within the CDC have argued that vet erinary skills have been put to much broaderuse since the disbanding of the veterinary publichealth unit.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2124,In 1997 Peter Schantz a veterinaryparasitologist at CDC documented that there wereﬁfty nine veterinarians at CDC assigned to elevendifferent centers institutes or program ofﬁces.Besides programs carrying out research and con trol of zoonotic diseases veterinarians worked asepidemiologists and research scientists on otherinfectious diseases including HIV AIDS human immunodeﬁciency virus acquired immunodeﬁ ciency syndrome and on the national immuni zation program environmental health occupa tional health and international health.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2125,It was really only when infectious diseases began to reemerge as a global problem in the1980s and 1990s that veterinary public health cameback into prominence. This is largely because vet erinary education traditionally oriented to farmlivestock has been at the forefront of understand ing the epidemiological features of infectious dis eases in populations. It is no accident for instance that the protective effects for a population ofvaccinating part of that population is termed a herd effect.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2126,Furthermore the wide scope ofveterinary education lends itself well to studyingand controlling zoonotic and food borne illnesses which became important areas of interest at thebeginning of the twenty ﬁrst century. Animal diseases may threaten human health in two ways 1 they may threaten the animalpopulations that serve as food transportation ortraction power in the ﬁelds and 2 throughzoonotic diseases that are transmissable to humans.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2127,NONZOONOTIC ANIMAL DISEASES OF PUBLIC HEALTH IMPORTANCE Cattle plague or rinderpest which affects all clo ven hoofed animals may serve as an example ofhow an epidemic disease in animals may havecatastrophic effects on public health through avariety of indirect ways.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2128,The virus which causesrinderpest related to canine distemper and hu man measles was once endemic in Central Asiaand made periodic forays into Europe where itkilled off tens of millions of cattle in the eighteenthcentury despite strong quarantine measures stimu lating the creation of Europe s ﬁrst veterinaryschools. Rinderpest arrived in the lower Nile Val ley with the British campaigns into the Sudan in1884 through 1885.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2129,The prosperous cattle cul tures further south however were initially pro tected by the Sahara Desert. Then in 1889 the Italian army invading Eritrea brought cattle withthem for provisioning. The disease then spreadsouth in great devastating waves killing millions ofcattle and destroying the wealthy cattle based sub Saharan civilizations. A third of the Ethiopian VETERINARY PUBLIC HEALTH 1280human population is estimated to have died as a result of this cattle plague.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2130,In what is today Tanzania fewer than 5 percent of 4.5 million cattle survived.Villages disappeared pastoral people were forcedto become sedentary and sedentary people losttheir beasts of burden. About two thirds of theMasai people starved to death. The way was opened up for European settlers and Bantu agricultural ists who of course viewed their conquests as signs of superiority rather than as an exercise incarpet bagging.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2131,One white South African source isquoted as saying that the ravages of rinderpest although reducing the native to poverty has notbeen without beneﬁcial results and the native hasnow learnt humility to those to whom he is subor dinate. Many wildlife species especially largeungulates like buffalo eland giraffe and kuduwere decimated and carnivores deprived of theirnormal food took to open attacks on people andother nonsusceptible species.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2132,The disease also destroyed initially the natu ral hosts for tsetse ﬂies which spread blood bornetrypanosome parasites that cause sleeping sicknessin people the disease thus disappeared from wide areas of its historic habitat. Both wildlife and thescrub woodlands that support tsetse ﬂies reboundedmore quickly than the cattle and their associatedgrasslands.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2133,This created misconceptions amongEuropeans about the nature of African civiliza tions the ecology of Africa in general and aboutthe zoonotic nature of sleeping sickness. Manysub Saharan African ecosystems have at differentpoints in history self organized around wildlife woodland species and cattle grassland species. Cur rent conservation efforts have been directed toconserve the wildlife woodland system which isalso more hospitable to tsetse ﬂies and endemicsleeping sickness.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2134,This is one of many exampleswhere the veterinary activities if allowed to taketheir appropriate place alongside ecologists and human health practitioners can make profoundcontributions to our understanding of sustainablepublic health.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2135,More recently the public health effects of major epidemics of such nonzoonotic animal dis eases as foot and mouth disease and both classicaland African swine fever have been buffered andsoftened by social and economic safety nets aswell as rapid veterinary public health and eco nomic responses.ZOONOSES The second way in which animal diseases may be of importance for public health is when the agentsthat cause them can be transmitted to people.The World Health Organization WHO deﬁneszoonoses as those diseases and infections theagents of which are naturally transmitted between other vertebrate animals and people .
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2136,This is a good clear deﬁnition and includes most of thediseases such as rabies brucellosis tuberculosis Q Fever Lyme disease salmonellosis hydatid dis ease and sleeping sickness which are convention ally viewed as being zoonoses. However this deﬁ nition is often stretched to include many infec tions that people share with other animals eitherdirectly or indirectly. In some cases such ashistoplasmosis and blastomycosis animals createconditions which allow the disease organisms toproliferate more easily.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2137,This broader net also in cludes other animal associated illnesses such asallergies as well as the beneﬁcial effects of animalownership ranging from lowered blood pressureand survival after heart attacks to serving as substi tute social networks in time of crisis for eld erly people. Most often humans are accidental hosts of zoonotic agents. The exceptions are some tape worms such as Taenia solium Taenia saginata and Diphyllobothrium latum for which humans are the deﬁnitive host.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2138,In these cases the agent is recycledback to people when they ingest meat from pigs cattle and ﬁsh respectively which have had themisfortune of ingesting infested human feces. Thesediseases are clearly tied to public hygiene meas ures as well as animal feeding practices. Zoonoses may be classiﬁed according to their maintenance cycles. Direct zoonoses such asleptospirosis hantaviruses and anthrax may beperpetuated in nature by a single vertebrate spe cies.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2139,Cyclozoonoses have maintenance cycles thatrequire more than one vertebrate species but noinvertebrates. Echinococcus multilocularis a tape worm of canids that goes through intermediatestages in ruminants or omnivores is an example.Metazoonoses require both vertebrates and inver tebrates such as ticks or mosquitoes to complete their life cycle.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2140,American trypanosomiasis Chagas disease spread by triatomid kissing bugs LymeDisease spread by deer ticks plague spread by VETERINARY PUBLIC HEALTH 1281rat ﬂeas and leishmaniasis Kala Azar spread by sand ﬂies are metazoonotic diseases. Saprozoonoses depend on inanimate reser voirs or development sites such as soil water orplants as well as vertebrate hosts.

Toxocara canis and T. catis which exist as roundworm infections in dogs and cats require anexternal environment to become infective for peo ple.

FOOD BORNE ZOONOSES After a half century of seeming to be under con trol food borne diseases reemerged in the 1980sas a major class of human infections.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2143,Most of theagents associated with the current worldwide in creases in cases of food borne diseases Salmo nella DT104 Salmonella enteritidis Escherichia coli 0157 H7 Campylobacter jejuni Listeria monocytogenes and the prions associated with bovine spongiformencephalopathy mad cow disease and its hu man form new variant Creuzfeldt Jakob disease nvCJD have their reservoirs in animal popula tions.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2144,In most cases they cannot be controlledwithout a full multispecies understanding of thefood chain from stable to table. Veterinary pub lic health has therefore become a much moreactive ﬁeld of inquiry and activity than it was in themid twentieth century. The reasons for the global increases in food borne diseases are complex and have revealedweaknesses in how modern agriculture is organ ized.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2145,Industrialized agriculture tends to encourageeconomies of scale to keep prices down and largegroups of animals are often gathered into oneplace. Poultry and swine are often kept in largegroups throughout their lives. Cattle may be keptin a dispersed manner when young but are thengathered into large feedlots for fattening.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2146,Sincethe conditions which promote epidemics are a function of the size of the susceptible populationand the probability of adequate contact itself afunction of the agents and the methods of spread these large populations of animals are vulnerableto epidemic diseases. In an attempt to control thisvulnerability veterinarians have worked closelywith various livestock industries to set up herdhealth or ﬂock health programs.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2147,When thesehave broken down as all programs eventually do especially those requiring high labor energy oreducational inputs there have been catastrophicepidemics of diseases such as hog cholera salmo nella or foot and mouth disease. But these econo mies of scale have also created epidemic condi tions for agents which may not only affect thelivestock themselves. No matter how they are kept most livestock or livestock products such as milk are processedin centralized facilities.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2148,At some point in the mod ern food system the bacteria and viruses froma wide variety of sources are brought togetherin one place. This allows not only for cross contamination but for wide dispersal of the agentsso gathered since these centralized processingindustries must in order to remain economicallyviable serve large populations.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2149,The biological effects of these economies of scale have been exacerbated by the economic pres sure to become more efﬁcient hence animal wastes organs and parts of animals not consid ered ﬁt for human consumption have been re processed rendered into protein supplements meat and bone meal or MBM through variousheat and chemical processes. These allow animalsto grow faster or produce more milk. Economi cally this seems to make sense.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2150,Ecologically how ever this has created ideal conditions for thespread and enhancement of food borne illnesses.Well before the epidemic of BSE in Britain in the1980s and 1990s salmonellosis was known to in crease and be magniﬁed throughout the foodsystem through the synergistic effects associated with scale and efﬁciency. The epidemic of BSE in the United Kingdom had several contributory factors.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2151,Not the least of these was a large ratio of sheep 40 million com pared with 8 million in the United States to cattle 12 million compared to 104 million in the UnitedStates .
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2152,Furthermore there was a high prevalence VETERINARY PUBLIC HEALTH 1282of scrapie infected sheep in the United Kingdom scrapie is a well known but little understood trans missible spongiform encephalopathy of sheep .Thus in the United Kingdom rendered animalprotein was 14 percent sheep derived comparedto 0.6 percent in the United States and much ofthe sheep derived MBM came from scrapie infectedsheep.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2153,Then in the late 1970s changes in theeconomic value of tallow and fats and deregula tion of the rendering industry affected the propor tion of MBM processed with hydrocarbon fat sol vents which fell from about 70 percent in the mid 1970s to about 10 percent in the early 1980s. It ishypothesized that this helped create conditions which allowed infective prions to slip through the system. The BSE epidemic not only clariﬁed some of the weaknesses in how post Word War II agricul ture was organized.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2154,It also uncovered some struc tural problems in the relationships between veteri nary and human public health. The ﬁrst cases ofBSE in cattle were reported in 1986. Within twoyears it became clear that there was a seriousepidemic of a new disease in cattle underway anda series of well designed veterinary epidemiologi cal studies were done. As the epidemic unfolded the emphasis shifted between concerns for BSE asan animal disease to BSE as a public health economic and sociopolitical problem.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2155,Althoughthe epidemic was brought rapidly under controlthrough various draconian measures the lack offormal structures to link these various concerns ina systemic manner has been costly not only interms of lives lost to nvCJD but also through thebroad preventable public health impacts medi ated through economic and agricultural restruc turing. Public health workers have tended to viewtransmissible spongiform encephalopathies TSEs such as CJD as rare geographically widespread and species speciﬁc.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2156,However those who workedwith animal TSEs such as scrapie saw them asendemic in many countries with evidence thatthey were capable of crossing species barriers. Anintegrated veterinary public health system mighthave made much earlier use of this information. As indicated earlier Salmonella epidemics in poultry had identiﬁed the recycling of animalproteins back into animal feeds for reasons ofefﬁciency as problematic even before the BSEepidemic.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2157,Similarly the use of antimicrobials inanimal feeds again for reasons of efﬁciency andcost had underlined the fact that there could be serious public health consequences to such prac tices. There was evidence in the 1970s that feedingof antimicrobials to animals for growth promo tion or as prophylaxis could promote the spreadof resistant bacteria. What also became apparentwas how easily bacteria can share genetic codingfor resistance and the degree to which resist ance to various drugs might be linked.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2158,An under standing of the ecology of microbial populationsin the food chain has improved even as newstrains of multidrug resistant bacteria such asSalmonella DT104 have emerged as serious hu man pathogens in North America and Europe.The links between microbial ecology veterinarypractices and public health have made this anincreasing area of concern for veterinary publichealth practitioners.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2159,OTHER ZOONOSES If agricultural activities have created epidemic conditions for food borne diseases and problemswith antibiotic resistance they have alsocontributed along with land use and climatic andcultural changes to creating ecological condi tions suitable for a range of other zoonoses. Amongthese arboviruses small simple RNA viruses car ried by arthropods insects spiders crustaceans are particularly sensitive to changes in habitat andclimate.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2160,Arboviruses multiply in the arthropods which transmit them between vertebrate hosts.Thus the incidence and spread of infection issensitive to increases in standing water mosquitobreeding sites which can be caused by irrigationsystems as well as increased rainfall and tempera ture due to global climate changes. Hence theyoften appear in seasonal epidemics. The feedinghabits of the mosquitoes whether they favor onehost or switch according to availability are alsoimportant.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2161,For many of these viruses small mam mals and birds act as important reservoirs becausethey provide a steady supply of new suscepti ble hosts. Of the 535 arboviruses catalogued some 100 are known to cause human illness ranging fromgeneral fevers and muscle and joint pain tohemorrhagic symptoms and encephalitis. Many ofthese also cause similar illnesses in domestic ani mals.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2162,Large long lived vertebrates may actuallyserve to slow an epidemic since they develop strong VETERINARY PUBLIC HEALTH 1283immunity and because they tend to develop low level viremias are not considered an importantsource of reinfection for other animals.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2163,Theseinclude various equine encephalitis viruses whichhave been well studied for decades such as thoseassociated with Western Eastern and St. LouisEncephalitis as well as others like West Nile virus that emerged as major concerns at least in Europeand North America at the turn of the millennium.They also include the agents of Rift Valley fever yellow fever and Japanese encephalitis.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2164,Evendengue fever which is transmitted by the yellowfever mosquito Aedes aegypti may have its origins in a treetop jungle cycle between wild primatesand sylvatic mosquitoes. The relationships between emerging infec tious diseases and global environmental changehave been stimulated not just by arboviral infec tions. At least two direct zoonoses hantaviruspulmonary syndrome and leptospirosis are sen sitive to these changes. A few years ago few peopleoutside of military circles had ever heard ofhantaviruses.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2165,Military people knew about thembecause they caused epidemic hemorrhagic feversand kidney problems for troops in South Korea.Over three thousand United Nations personnelwere infected. Indeed this version of the diseasehas been reported around the world for manydecades. Only in 1993 when a new version of thedisease seemed to emerge in the American south west did something approaching panic spreadthrough the medical community.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2166,This illustrates aglobal rule of disease emergence diseases areimportant if politically or economically powerfulpeople deem them to be so. Being associated with drought ﬂoods and plagues of rodents the story of hantavirus pulmo nary syndrome has strong biblical resonances. Inthe spring of 1992 six years of drought in the FourCorners region of the southwestern United Statesended in torrential rains. In the wake of the ﬂoodscame piñon nuts and grasshoppers and then aplague of deer mice.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2167,In one year the deer mousepopulation increased tenfold bringing the littlecreatures into much closer contact with farmersand other rural residents. By the time the mousepopulation started declining in 1993 forty twopeople had succumbed to an illness that startedwith fever nausea and vomiting and ended fortwenty six of the forty two with ﬂuid in the lungs and then death.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2168,This emergence of hantaviruspulmonary syndrome demonstrated that the dis ruption of ecosystems whatever the cause was notmerely an environmental issue. In many ways hantavirus infection is simi lar to leptospirosis. Both are associated with spi ral shaped bacteria that prosper in warm moistplaces like kidneys and bladders. Neither of thesediseases require a ﬂea or other invertebrate tohelp complete their life cycle.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2169,The difference be tween hantaviruses and leptospires is that theleptospiral bacteria can survive longer in the en vironment and thus are more likely to be di rectly affected by changes in temperature andrainfall patterns as a result of global environmen tal changes. Leptospirosis is believed to be themystery killer disease which appeared in Nica ragua in 1996 after extensive ﬂooding.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2170,Bothleptospires and hantaviruses however are spreadthrough rat urine and its aerosolized forms andboth are closely associated with agricultural andmilitary occupations that demand intensive med dling in restructured natural environments whererats make their homes. Hantaviruses may havestarted as pathogens of poor housing conditionsand poverty but the North American middle classinfatuation with visiting or living in natural land scapes has spread these agents to all socioeco nomic levels.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2171,Concern with food borne and other emerging infectious diseases many of which are zoonotic has certainly broken down many barriers betweenveterinary and mainstream public health. Thepresence of veterinary epidemiologists at interna tional public health conferences is no longer con sidered an aberration. Veterinarians are active inmost public health departments in industrializedcountries.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2177,From the point of view of under standing and promoting public health in a sustain able fashion these integrative initiatives were longoverdue. Veterinary public health growing from an orientation toward animal populations and chas tened by economic limits has always drawn stronglyon epidemiological methods of investigation andcontrol. Before the twentieth century many ofthese methods were based on various ecologicalobservations as well as military and agriculturalnecessity.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2178,As early as the fourth century MarcusTerrentius Varro observing diseases of livestockin Rome noted that there are bred in swamps certain minute creatures which cannot be seen bythe eyes which ﬂoat in the air and enter the bodythrough the mouth and nose and cause seriousdisease. Based on this kind of understanding population health management quarantine masstreatments and mass vaccinations were a well developed method of controlling animal diseaseswell before they became standard public healthpractices.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2185,Asthe injury and death toll from violent behaviorhave become increasingly evident multidisciplinaryscholarship in the study of violence has emergedand expanded at an unprecedented pace. The most widely accepted deﬁnition of violence sometimes termed intentional inter personal injury is behavior by persons againstpersons that intentionally threatens attempts oractually inﬂicts physical harm Reiss and Roth 1993 .
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2186,The closely related terms aggression and antisocial behavior are generally applied to lesserforms of violence and include but are not limitedto behaviors that are intended to inﬂict psycho logical harm as well as physical harm.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2187,The public health approach to the study and prevention of violence entails a four step process 1 data collection of violence related problems assets and resources 2 assessment of the possi ble causes of violence through risk factor identiﬁ cation 3 the establishment and evaluation ofviolence prevention strategies and 4 the dissemi nation and implementation of effective strategies.Public health then is inherently a research drivenand prevention oriented science.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2188,This approachcomplements and overlaps with the narrower fo cus of criminology which is primarily concernedwith forms of violence that constitute crimes andwith policies and practices that deter and punishperpetrators.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2189,VIOLENT VICTIMIZATION Epidemiological data on violence are derived from three primary sources 1 hospital emergencymedical service and medical examiner records 2 police reports and arrest records and otheragency records such as child protective servicesfor reports of child abuse and 3 self reportsurveys and interviews. In addition specializedstudies that address the particular dynamics andcontexts of violence have proven to be importantto the understanding and prevention of violence.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2190,The most complete and accurate violence related datasets are those on homicide victims. Inthe United States the overall homicide victimiza tion rate has ﬂuctuated during the twentieth cen tury from fewer than two homicides per 100 000 in1900 to a high of nearly eleven homicides per100 000 in 1980. In 1998 17 893 individuals weremurdered in the United States which translatesinto an average daily death toll of forty nine peo ple.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2191,The worldwide 1998 homicide rate was 12.5per 100 000 signiﬁcantly higher than the U.S.homicide rate of 6.2 per 100 000. Nevertheless data from the 1980s reveal that among the forty one most developed countries the United States has the third highest homicide rate. Because violence is not evenly distributed throughout the population these overall homi cide rates provide only a partial picture of homi cide s toll.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2192,Most notably homicide victimization inthe United States is most prevalent among youth.In 1998 homicide was the second leading cause ofdeath among ﬁfteen to twenty four year olds. Racialdisparities in homicide rates are also disturbinglyhigh. During the second half of the twentiethcentury African Americans were murdered at ﬁveto eleven times the rate of their white counter parts. Gender differences are equally as dramatic with males murdered at approximately ten timesthe rate of females.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2193,Finally the risk of homicide ishigher in urban than nonurban areas as well aswithin neighborhoods characterized by concen trated poverty. Neighborhood social disorganiza tion also increases the probability of violence vic timization as well as perpetration. In comparative studies conducted in the 1990s the homicide victimization rates in the UnitedStates particularly among children and adoles cents were shown to be several times higher thanthose in any other industrialized country.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2194,In fact the homicide rate for children under sixteen yearsold in the United States was ﬁve times higher thanthe corresponding homicide rate for the nexttwenty ﬁve richest countries combined. The rea sons for these elevated homicide rates in the UnitedStates are not fully understood however probablecauses include easier access to ﬁrearms morecommon and severe patterns of income dispari ties and higher levels of racial and ethnic diversityin conjunction with racist and xenophobic atti tudes and behaviors.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2195,The question of mechanism or the means by which people are murdered or injured is another VIOLENCE 1286critical piece of information with respect to our understanding and prevention of violence. Theexamination of mechanism was particularly help ful in understanding the tremendous increase inhomicide victimization rates of adolescents in theUnited States from 1987 to 1993 and the subse quent downturn through 1998.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2196,When the dataare disaggregated by mechanism a clear pictureemerges These trends over time can be accountedfor by changes in the number and proportion ofyouth murdered with a ﬁrearm see Figure 1 .
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2197,Thechanges in gun use during this period are gener ally attributed to three major factors the crackepidemic which had the effect of destabilizinglocal drug trafﬁcking markets rendering themmore volatile and violent and the subsequentpetering out of this epidemic changes in eco nomic opportunity and changes in policing policyfor gun violations. Most assaultive behavior however does not result in death.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2198,In 1997 more than 1.75 millionpeople in the United States were treated forassaultive injuries in emergency departments andmore than 10 million individuals aged twelve andover reported that they had been victims of violentcrimes. These and other data reveal that youngpeople African Americans and males are dispro portionately victimized by nonlethal forms of vio lence though these disparities are less pronouncedthan for homicide victimization.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2199,VIOLENCE PERPETRATION AND ASSOCIATED RISK FACTORS The number and characteristics of individuals who commit murder cannot be precisely determinedbecause of limitations in law enforcement report ing systems and because identifying information about perpetrators are only available for cases inwhich an arrest is made or the perpetrator isotherwise identiﬁed.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2200,Still some reasonably soundinformation about adolescents who murder is avail able About nine in ten are male more than halfare African American approximately half act alone most kill individuals who are close in age and ofthe same ethnic background and most use a ﬁre arm. The peak or modal age among homicideperpetrators occurs in the late teens and earlytwenties.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2201,Since the rampage shooting at Columbine High School in the spring of 1999 much concernabout violence at schools has been aired and fears that such events could happen anywhere haveemerged. Contrary to these perceptions however the number and rate of youth initiated schoolviolence both lethal and nonlethal generally de creased or at worst remained relatively stable during the 1990s.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2202,Like the homicide victimizationrates the overall juvenile homicide perpetrationrate as well as the aggregate juvenile offendingrate for serious forms of violence rose precipi tously in the late 1980s peaked during the early tomid 1990s and then decreased through the begin ning of the twenty ﬁrst century. School basedhomicides constitute only 1 percent or fewer of allhomicides committed by young people and schoolsremain one of the safest environments for chil dren and adolescents.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2203,Equally important to estimating the scope of violence perpetration among youth are efforts toidentify risk factors the characteristics that whenpresent increase the probability that a young per son will subsequently engage in violent acts. Thereare ﬁve important aspects of risk factors. First riskfactors tend to be additive the more risk factorsthat are present the more elevated the risk ofviolence. A single risk factor generally has lowpredictive power.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2204,Even among those children andadolescents with multiple risk factors few willbecome violent. Second risk factors occur andneed to be addressed at multiple levels includingindividual family peer group school and neigh borhood or community levels. Third differentrisk factors pertain to different points in the lifespan with family level factors playing a greater role foryounger children and peer group and neighbor hood factors playing a greater role for older chil dren.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2205,Fourth some risk factors are speciﬁc tocertain types of violent behavior e.g. risk factorsfor sexual violence may be quite different thanthose for robbery . And ﬁfth the severity of risk factor exposure is likely to increase or decreaserisk proportionately e.g. extreme and chronicchild abuse is likely to have a more profound effectthan lesser forms of child maltreatment .
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2206,Several literature reviews have been under taken on risk factors that increase the probabilitythat children and young teens will subsequentlyengage in violent behavior.

Therefore somefactors that may in reality increase subsequent riskfor violence perpetration may not have been iden tiﬁed in the extant literature because they havebeen inadequately researched or because of theircomplexity the potency of a risk factor may besigniﬁcantly affected by speciﬁc contextualizedcircumstances e.g.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2209,bystander support neighbor hood norms and personal history. Similarly onefactor may only become a risk factor or maybecome a more potent risk factor when it occursin tandem with another factor. During childhood the two most powerful pre dictors of subsequent violence perpetration aresubstance use and delinquency.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2210,Additional lesspotent risk factors include aggressive behavior family violence inconsistent overly lax and harshdisciplinary practices association with antisocialpeers and poor attitudes toward schooling. Media violence has been shown to increase aggression in the short term but such exposure has notbeen linked directly to violent adolescent behav ior. Conversely attempts to reduce violencethrough media advocacy e.g. the Squash It campaign have not been shown to reduce rates ofviolence signiﬁcantly.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2211,During the early adolescent years three major and interrelated risk factors have been identiﬁed weak associational ties with nondelinquent peers strong associational ties with antisocial and delin quent peers and gang membership. Gang mem bership in particular appears to fulﬁll important psychological needs with regard to peer accept ance and belonging as well as the need for en hanced social status particularly for unpopularyouth and for those youth who feel socially power less.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2212,Because gangs serve these fundamental needs efforts to dissuade young people from joiningyouth gangs is a more efﬁcient strategy than tryingto entice them out of the gang after they have VIOLENCE 1288joined particularly since gangs typically promise to provide valued incentives such as money powerand status excitement and for males promises ofsexual favors.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2213,On the other hand to ignorecurrent gang members or rely exclusively on puni tive law enforcement efforts is an inefﬁcient andineffective violence reduction strategy. Communi ty based outreach efforts in association with com munity policing operations are required.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2214,Such efforts need to address the psychological interper sonal and economic needs of gang members theyshould be based upon multiple sources of informa tion about local gang activity and they shouldinclude collaborative efforts involving the police schools social service agencies former gang mem bers and grassroots organizations.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2215,Additional risk factors during the early adoles cent years include antisocial behavior attending aschool in which gangs are prevalent having been avictim of a violent crime and residing in a high crime neighborhood and or in neighborhoodsthat have high levels of social disorganization.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2216,While quantitative risk factor analyses are im portant qualitative studies based on in depth in terviews focus groups and intensive ﬁeld studies of particular groups of youth provide insights into the dynamics underlying risk factor analyses andpoint to additional factors or combinations offactors that may be fruitful to study.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2217,These studiesare important given the generally weak overallpredictive power yielded from risk factor analyses.Examples of such studies include James Garbarino s1999 study of children and adolescents who havecommitted violent crimes Elijah Anderson s 1999study of the impact of street and cultural norms inan impoverished African American section of Phila delphia John Devine s extensive 1996 ﬁeld studiesof school violence in New York City and FelixPadilla s in depth 1992 study of the dynamics andculture of a Latino gang in Chicago.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2218,These richlytextured studies and others like them capture the complex and tragic nature of acts of violence.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2219,Theyalso provide insights about the psychological logicand developmental history of those who commitviolent acts reminding us that even the most vicious forms of violence can ultimately be under stood though not justiﬁed as uniquely humanresponses to a volatile mix of difﬁcult circum stances and experiences combined with speciﬁcpersonality and character dynamics.PREVENTION STRATEGIES Four major interrelated approaches to the preven tion of violence have been articulated 1 theinculcation or enhancement of protective factors factors that reduce the probability of violenceperpetration among individuals exposed to knownrisk factors and or a corresponding reduction inthe number or severity of risk factors 2 theadoption of self contained violence preventionprograms 3 the speciﬁcation of generic strate gies e.g.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2220,social skills training derived by group ing effective and promising programs accordingto the approach they adopt and the speciﬁc pro gram characteristics they utilize and 4 the eluci dation of framing principles that guide the estab lishment and implementation of programs. The use of mechanical and electronic surveil lance devices e.g.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2221,metal detectors and the estab lishment of laws law enforcement policies judicialprocessing and incarcerative practices remain pri marily in the domain of criminology and need tobe better integrated with public health approaches.One successful example of this kind of compre hensive and integrated approach was establishedin Boston. This strategy involved several agenciesand programs working together to reduce gun andgang related violence.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2222,The police probation ofﬁ cers and courts addressed surveillance interdiction and enforcement legislators passed tougher pen alties for gun related violence researchers con ducted analyses of gun violations and social work ers and religious leaders counseled at risk youth in the use of nonviolent conﬂict resolution tech niques and offered employment opportunities andprogram activities. Other approaches to violenceprevention such as changes in public policies e.g.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2223,foster care policies school reform and em ployment and housing strategies have receivedonly passing attention within the public healthﬁeld with the notable exception of the signiﬁcantattention paid to ﬁrearm policies. The study of protective factors has been spurred by the long standing observation that some chil dren who are exposed to several known risk fac tors do not become violent or otherwise seriouslyimpaired.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2224,The task then is to identify common characteristics or circumstances that buffer theseresilient children from the ill effects of exposure toknown risk factors. The scientiﬁc study of protec tive factors however is in its infancy and the VIOLENCE 1289evidence from this small body of literature is sug gestive rather than conclusive. The most well documented protective factor is maintaining conventional values including therejection of aggressive or violent behavior as anappropriate means to resolve conﬂict.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2225,This charac teristic is associated with the peer level protectivefactor of associating with peers who hold prosocialvalues. At the family level a warm and supportiverelationship with one s parents or guardians andengagement in familial bonding activities havebeen associated with reduced levels of aggression. As children move into the more high risk ado lescent years family factors alone do not con tinue to exert a powerful protective effect.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2226,Theinnoculative effects of protective factors appear torequire developmentally appropriate exposures ateach stage of development. At the school level commitment to school has been identiﬁed as aprotective factor. Finally because neighborhoodand societal change are so difﬁcult to study incontrolled studies and also so challenging to ad dress protective factors at these levels have notbeen identiﬁed. The development and implementation of self contained violence prevention programs has along standing history.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2227,The introduction of scien tiﬁc methods to assess the effectiveness of suchprograms however only commenced in the 1980s with the number and rigor of such evaluationsaccelerating rapidly during the 1990s. Still scien tiﬁc evaluations are very costly and only a smallproportion of programs now in use at schools andin communities have been rigorously evaluated.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2228,The programs that have been evaluated are generally highly structured implemented by pro fessionals and developed at academic institutions.While this body of research has revealed that someprograms do indeed reduce rates of aggression and violence and that some programs clearly donot work it is inaccurate to assume that programsthat have not been evaluated do not work orconversely that they are effective.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2229,It is also inaccurate to conclude that programs that have been shown to be effective will workequally well in all settings and contexts. Very littleis known about whether or how programs needto be adapted from one setting to another. Someprograms may not work equally well for males andfemales some may work well in urban but not rural settings and some programs may work inone cultural context but not another.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2230,Some pro grams are appropriate for all children or youthwithin a designated age range universal or pri mary prevention some are appropriate for chil dren and youth exhibiting or possessing knownrisk factors selective or secondary prevention and some programs are appropriate for youth whohave already engaged in violence or serious delin quent behavior indicated or tertiary prevention .
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2231,In the late 1990s and early 2000s several compendia of effective promising and ineffectiveviolence prevention programs were issued. Theseinclude reports by the Surgeon General the Cen ters for Disease Control and Prevention the Cen ter for the Study and Prevention of Violence the Ofﬁce of Justice Programs the National Re search Council the Violence Institute of NewJersey M. W. Lipsey and D. B. Wilson 1998 and M. B. Greene 1998 .
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2232,The major strategiesthat have been shown to be effective along withbrief descriptions of illustrative programs are sum marized below however readers interested in afull explication of such strategies along with de tailed descriptions of effective and promising pro grams are urged to consult sources listed in thebibliography. The most widely adopted violence prevention strategy emphasizes social skills training to resolveconﬂict without resorting to aggressive or violenttactics.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2233,Social skills training programs generallyutilize structured and interactive curricula e.g. role playing and are usually classroom based. Oneexample of an effective social skills training pro grams is Promoting Alternative Thinking Strate gies or PATHS.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2234,This program is designed forchildren from kindergarten through ﬁfth gradeand focuses on ﬁve speciﬁc skills emotional liter acy self control social competence positive peerrelations and interpersonal problem solving.School based sessions are taught for approximatelythirty minutes each and the program developers recommend that these lessons should be taught three times per week. A second overall strategy focuses on parent training and family dynamics.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2235,This approach isboth educational and therapeutic and based onthe theory that a caring supportive and stable VIOLENCE 1290family life will provide the initial grounding to deter children from subsequently engaging in ag gressive delinquent or violent behavior. Mostcommonly programs are designed to work withparents of young children and are focused onparental decision making communication moni toring and sanctioning strategies and on educat ing parents about child development.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2236,Several family based strategies have been shown to be highly effective in reducing aggressive and or violentbehavior. Home visitation in which therapeutic guid ance is provided to parents in their residence hasgained much recognition in recent years. One ofthe most effective home visitation programs is theNurse Home Visitation Program in which a trainednurse visits the home setting during the latterstages of pregnancy through the point at which thechild reaches age two.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2237,Long term follow up studiesindicate that the adolescent children of programparticipants had signiﬁcantly fewer arrests thancontrol group adolescents. In addition two family oriented programs for adolescents who have ex hibited violent and delinquent behavior have alsobeen shown to be effective Functional Family Therapy and Multisystemic Therapy.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2238,Both pro grams provide intensive family and individual ther apy as well as guidance to parents in addressingpractical and everyday problems and both have effected signiﬁcant reductions in subsequent de linquent and violent behavior. A deﬁning feature of a third approach to violence prevention is the central role played byyoung people in the program s operation andimplementation.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2239,Four principles underlie suchprograms 1 young people understand their ownpeer culture and what kinds of program compo nents are feasible 2 young people provide atypically untapped human resource 3 programnorms are more readily diffused through the net work of involved youth and 4 the involvement byyoung people in implementing such programs provides an alternative for antisocial violent and delinquent behavior.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2240,The most popular of thisclass of programs is school based peer mediation in which a trained student mediates a disputebetween two other students with the goal of estab lishing a mutually agreed upon peaceful solution.Other types of programs engage young people incommunity organizing or advocacy activities.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2241,Whilethe small number of peer operated programs that have been rigorously evaluated has not shownsigniﬁcant reductions in violent or delinquent be havior the theoretical promise of these programs the fact that many types of youth led programshave not been evaluated and the inherent com plexity in evaluating such programs suggest that adecision to forgo or eliminate such programs ispremature.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2242,Nevertheless sound policy also sug gests that programs should be discontinued if theycontinuously fail to demonstrate their effectiveness. Another class of programs utilizes psycho educational strategies to reduce the likelihood ofengagement in violent behavior. The most well known type of program within this class of pro grams is mentoring.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2243,While not all mentoring pro grams are effective the Big Brothers Big Sistersprogram model has been rigorously evaluated andshown to be an effective violence prevention strat egy. Stand alone individual counseling however is considered an ineffective violence preventionstrategy. Another type of program involves counsel ing and supportive services for youth who havebeen exposed to violence either as victims oras witnesses both of which are risk factors forsubsequent perpetration.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2244,In one such program the Child Development Community Policing Pro ject police ofﬁcers receive training in child de velopment and the dynamics of psychologicaltrauma and work together with mental healthclinicians who receive training in police prac tices and culture in identifying and respondingto children who have been exposed to violence.This program illustrates the potential value ofintegrating clinical and law enforcementapproaches.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2245,Finally some programs are hybrids either combining two or more of the approaches out lined above or not ﬁtting neatly into any of thefour approaches. One hybrid is Olweus s Bully ing Prevention Program. This program has sev eral key features including skills based classroomtraining parent involvement policy development hot spot analysis and counseling. Evaluations ofthis program suggest that it is effective in reduc ing levels of bullying and harassment.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2246,Indeed multicomponent programs are generally viewedas preferable particularly for high risk youth. VIOLENCE 1291Public health efforts to address gun related violence also do not ﬁt neatly into any of theapproaches outlined above.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2247,Strategies to reducegun violence include the promotion of laws andpolicies that reduce access to guns some evidenceof effectiveness the adoption of mechanical andelectronic means to make guns safer such astrigger locks and personalized guns the consis tency and quality of such devises are variable andnone has been adequately evaluated educatingchildren in safe gun practices ineffective gunbuybacks ineffective and public information cam paigns no evaluations have been conducted .
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2248,As indicated above an alternative way to ap proach violence prevention programming is byestablishing a set of framing principles that informtheir development. While this cannot be donewithout examining what is known from evaluationstudies and from risk and protective factor analyses it is too early in the evolution of such studies tosimply extract these principles from the programsthat have been subject to rigorous evaluation andproven to be effective or promising.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2249,Some of theprinciples listed below therefore owe more toﬁndings in other areas of public health than theydo to the violence prevention ﬁeld per se. Someprinciples have been described in earlier parts ofthis article e.g. that no single program or ap proach works equally in all settings and circum stances . What follows is a brief though not ex haustive list of such principles.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2250,The ﬁrst principle known as local ownership suggests that programs will be most successfullyoperated if the residents in the targeted neighbor hood and the speciﬁc group of individuals forwhom the program is designed to help are cen trally involved in the planning operation andadministration of the program. A second principlemultidisciplinarianism suggests that insights meth ods and approaches from multiple disciplines areneeded in developing and implementing violenceprevention programs.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2251,A third principle collabora tion suggests that no single agency or group cansuccessfully operate a program in isolation Vio lence prevention programs are inherently neigh borhood based and require the engagement ofmultiple stakeholders.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2252,A fourth principle suggests that a strength based focus should be emphasized focusing ex clusively on deﬁcits without drawing upon thestrengths and interests of the individuals the pro gram is designed to help and the resources avail able in the community will reduce the probabilityof success. A ﬁfth principle suggests that commit ted leadership is necessary for the successful plan ning and implementation of violence preventionprograms.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2253,Similarly staff development is also criti cal An untrained unsupported and unsupervisedstaff simply will not succeed in program imple mentation. Staff also need to be temperamentallysuited to the populations with which they work.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2254,Program accessibility is also critically impor tant If a program is sited in an undesirable loca tion turf issues are very important for youngpeople is sited in a difﬁcult to get to location oris physically unwelcoming or uninviting then theprogram will simply not attract participants. Speci ﬁcity is also important Programs need to set spe ciﬁc and measurable objectives otherwise theytend to ﬂounder and evaluation is renderedunfeasible.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2255,A ﬁnal principle is local ﬁt A pro gram s design and objectives should be derivedfrom a thorough and multipronged assessment ofthe nature and extent of the violence related prob lems in the neighborhood in which the programwill be implemented. Additionally new programsneed to ﬁt well into the context of existing pro grams and strategies.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2256,Perhaps it is ﬁtting to end with a quote from Surgeon General David Satcher taken from hispreface to the Surgeon General s report on youthviolence As a Nation we possess knowledge andhave translated that knowledge into programs thatare unequivocally effective in preventing muchserious youth violence.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2271,VIRAL INFECTIONS See Communicable Disease Control VIRCHOW RUDOLPH Rudolph Virchow 1821 1902 was one of the towering ﬁgures of nineteenth century medicine pathology and social reform.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2272,He studied medi cine in Berlin and taught there for a great part ofhis life with interludes in Silesia and Würzburg.His primary ﬁeld was pathology to which he madeproliﬁc contributions including the founding in 1847 of Archiv für pathologische Anatomie und Physiologie known as Virchow s Archives which still survives as a leading journal of pathology.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2273,In1848 he served on a commission to investigate anepidemic of typhus for which he wrote a penetrat ing report criticizing the social conditions thatfostered the spread of the disease. He had alreadyestablished a reputation as a crusading social re former and this report consolidated that reputa tion. He has since been identiﬁed as much withwhat came to be called social medicine as withhis primary specialty of pathology.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2274,Virchow s writings and speeches are full of observations and recommendations about ways toimprove people s health by improving their eco nomic and social conditions. He helped to shapethe health care reforms introduced in Germanyunder Otto von Bismarck. He entered politics serving in the German Reichstag 1880 1893 while also directing the Pathological Institute inBerlin. His proliﬁc writings while mainly on topicsin pathology included many essays and addresseson social medicine and public health.

Whenthese structures malfunction vision disorders oc cur. The key to treatment and resolution of thesedisorders is early detection through regular eye VISION DISORDERS 1294exams and prompt consultation with an ophthal mologist when problems occur. The best way to describe how vision works is to use the analogy of a camera.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2277,The pupil managesthe incoming light rays opening and closing likea camera shutter according to the amount oflight available. These light rays are progressivelyrefracted and focused by three structures thecornea a transparent convex cover over the irisand pupil in front of the eye the lens a sphericalbody behind the cornea and the vitreous humor agelatinous substance that ﬁlls the back of theeyeball.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2278,It is important that the rays be in sharpfocus when they reach the retina a sensory mem brane that lines the back of the eye and acts likeﬁlm in a camera. The retina converts the light raysinto electrical signals that are sent to the brain byway of the optic nerve. The brain then translatesthese electrical signals into what we know as sight. Refractive Errors. The most common vision disorders are refractive errors speciﬁcally near sightedness farsightedness and astigmatism.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2279,Ineach case the eye does not refract the incominglight properly so the image is blurred. While theyare not diseases refractive errors affect every agerange and comprise the largest treatment effort ofophthalmologists. Refractive errors can be suc cessfully corrected with eyeglasses contact lenses and laser refractive surgery. Cataract.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2280,A cataract results when the normally transparent lens of the eye clouds blurring vision.Most cataracts are age related advancing slowlyand progressively until functional blindness oc curs. Cataract cannot be prevented or cured withmedication or optical devices but it can be suc cessfully treated through a surgical procedure thatremoves the damaged natural eye lens and re places it with a permanent intraocular lens im plant. The procedure has over a 90 percent successrate.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2281,After refractive errors cataract is the mostcommon vision disorder. Macular Degeneration. Located in the retina the macula is responsible for central vision. Whenpeople have macular degeneration they can nolonger bring the center of the picture they see intofocus. The most common type of the disease is age related and there are two forms wet and dry.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2282,Whereas the wet form comprises only about 10percent of cases it causes the greatest vision loss striking quickly and without warning as a result of erupting blood vessels. The dry form is character ized by a slow progressive loss of vision from thethinning and tearing of the macula. Although bothforms are being extensively researched deﬁnitivecauses and treatments have not yet been identi ﬁed. Age related macular degeneration is the lead ing cause of blindness in most developed countries. Glaucoma.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2283,Glaucoma is a disease of the optic nerve. If the aqueous humor the clear ﬂuid thatﬁlls the front of the eye does not drain prop erly intraocular pressure builds damaging theoptic nerve and causing blind spots to develop.When the entire nerve is destroyed blindnessresults. If glaucoma is detected and treated in theearly stages loss of vision can be averted. How ever the disease is chronic and cannot be curedor reversed. Unfortunately the early stages aresymptomless.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2284,Once symptoms occur usually mani fested by loss of peripheral or side vision irrevers ible vision loss has already taken place. Treatmentconsists of medication and or surgery dependingon the type of glaucoma the patient s medicalhistory and the stage of the disease. Glaucoma isthe leading cause of blindness worldwide and thesecond leading cause in developed countries. Diabetic Retinopathy.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2285,Retinopathy is a side effect of diabetes and occurs as a result of ﬂuctua tions in the body s blood sugar a daily problem fordiabetics. When blood sugar ﬂuctuates over time it affects the blood vessels in various parts of thebody including the retina of the eye where theblood vessels can break and bleed causing blurredvision. The longer a person has diabetes the higherthe risk of retinopathy good diabetic control canforestall the disease however. Signs of retinopathyoften occur before symptoms appear.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2286,Treatmentincludes the use of laser photocoagulation to sealleaking blood vessels. Often undetected and un treated diabetic retinopathy is the leading causeof visual disability among working age people. Retinal Degenerations. Retinal degeneration is an umbrella term for a number of hereditary anddegenerative disorders that range from mild to profound vision loss and blindness. Retinitis pigmentosa is the most common type of retinaldegeneration affecting one in three thousandpeople.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2287,Its many forms have widely varied symp toms and onset and progress of the disease can be VITAL STATISTICS 1295slow or rapid. In general symptoms occur in childhood or young adulthood. Patients complainof night blindness followed by loss of visual ﬁeld.There is no treatment though researchers arehopeful that genetic therapies may be possible inthe future. Strabismus. Unlike most other vision disor ders strabismus is a physical defect. One or bothof the eyes are misaligned and point in differentdirections.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2288,One eye may look ahead while the other eye points up down in or out. Strabismus is more common in children than in adults.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2289,VITAL STATISTICS Vital statistics are perhaps the most widely used national state and local data for identifying andaddressing major public health issues. In the UnitedStates legal authority for the registration of vitalevents births deaths marriages divorces fetaldeaths and induced terminations of pregnancy abortions resides with the states and individu ally with New York City the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2290,The states are the legalproprietors of these data and are responsible formaintaining registries and issuing copies of therecords. The existence of a national data system of registration based vital statistics depends on a co operative relationship between the states and thefederal government.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2291,This relationship has evolvedover many decades with its initial beginnings inthe early development of the public health move ment and the creation of the American federalvital statistics system.THE HISTORY OF VITAL STATISTICS The registration of births marriages and deaths has a long history in the United States beginningwith registration laws enacted by the Grand Assem bly of Virginia in 1632 and the General Court ofthe Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1639.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2292,In enactingthis legislation the early settlers who were pre dominantly English were following English cus toms. Thus Virginia law required the clergy tokeep a record of all christenings marriages andburials in their parishes.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2293,The Massachusetts lawdiffered from Virginia s in two important respects it called for the recording of vital events births deaths and marriages rather than church related ceremonies and it placed responsibility for regis tration of vital events on government ofﬁcialsrather than the clergy.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2294,Little or no statistical usewas made of such records however along withwills and property inventories they were regardedprimarily as statements of fact essential to theprotection of individual rights especially thoserelating to the ownership and distribution ofproperty.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2295,The impetus for the use of vital records as the basis of a public health data system came from therealization that records of births and deaths par ticularly records of deaths by cause of death couldprovide information needed for the control ofepidemics and the conservation of human lifethrough sanitary reform. The origin of vital statis tics in the modern sense can be traced to ananalysis of the English bills of mortality publishedby John Graunt in 1662.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2296,Similarly the clergymanCotton Mather noted in 1721 during a severesmallpox epidemic in Boston that more than onein six of the natural cases died but only one in sixtyof the inoculated cases died.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2297,In the nineteenth century the industrial revo lution resulted in rapid urbanization overcrowd ing of cities and a deterioration of social and livingconditions for large sectors of the population.Public health reformers became acutely consciousof the need for general sanitary reform as a meansof controlling epidemics of disease particularlycholera.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2298,These early sanitarians used the crudedeath statistics of the time to arouse public aware ness of the need for improved sanitation and inthe process they pressed for more precise statisticsthrough effective registration practices and laws.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2299,VITAL STATISTICS 1296The work of Edwin Chadwick 1800 1890 and Dr. William Farr 1807 1883 in England and of LemuelShattuck 1793 1859 in Massachusetts was instru mental in the development of public health or ganization and practice including the recordingof vital statistics. Thus the history of public healthis largely the history of vital registration andstatistics. The United States Constitution provided for a decennial census but not a national vital registra tion system.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2300,To obtain national data on births marriages and deaths the decennial censuses inthe latter half of the nineteenth century includedquestions about vital events such as Born withinthe year Married within the year and Disease if died within the year. These census items weresoon recognized as inefﬁcient and the results asdeﬁcient.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2301,Therefore when the Bureau of the Cen sus was made a permanent agency of the federalgovernment in 1902 the enabling legislation au thorized the bureau to obtain annually copies ofrecords ﬁled in the vital statistics ofﬁces of thosestates and cities having adequate death registra tion systems and to publish data from these rec ords. This marked the birth of the National VitalStatistics System. Ten states and cities provided death records to the Census Bureau in 1902.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2302,In 1915 birth registration was added to the system and by 1933 all states were registering live birthsand deaths and providing the required data. In 1946 responsibility for collecting and pub lishing national vital statistics was transferred fromthe Census Bureau to the U.S. Public Health Ser vice ﬁrst in the National Ofﬁce of Vital Statisticsand later 1960 in the National Center for HealthStatistics NCHS .
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2303,In 1987 NCHS became part ofthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ofthe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. In the early part of the twentieth century the Bureau of the Census received unit record datafrom the states in hard copy or microﬁlm. Stateswere reimbursed for copying efforts at four centsper record.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2304,Data were transcribed later key en tered at both the national and state levels as bothstates and federal government produced statistics.In 1971 NCHS began an experiment with the stateof Florida to receive data on computer tape. Thiseffort expanded and evolved over time and by2000 electronic processing and transmission wasthe norm.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2305,NCHS provides partial funding support for state vital statistics efforts and also works withstates to implement standards for data elements editing and coding speciﬁcations quality controlprocedures and data transmission schedules. VITAL STATISTICS DATA FILES The National Vital Statistics System includes sev eral major electronic data ﬁles each containingthe demographic and health information recordedon all events that occur in the United States.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2306,Birthdata are recorded in the natality ﬁle which includes characteristics of mother s age race His panic origin education residence marital status month of pregnancy month prenatal care began tobacco use and weight gain during pregnancy.Characteristics of the birth include birth weight length of gestation sex plurality method of deliv ery and congenital anomalies.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2307,The mortality ﬁle variables include residence place of occurrence month of death age race Hispanic origin birthplace sex education mari tal status and underlying and multiple causes ofdeath. The fetal death ﬁle includes data on allfetal deaths of twenty weeks or more gestation.The characteristics of the mother and the deliveryare similar to those for natality but also includethe fetal or maternal conditions causing death.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2308,The linked birth infant death data system includes three separate ﬁles a numerator ﬁle withlinked birth infant death records for infants whodied during the period a denominator ﬁle of datafor all births and a ﬁle of the relatively few in fant death records that were not linked to birthcertiﬁcates. Unlike the natality and mortality systems de tailed data for marriages and divorces have nevercovered the entire United States.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2309,With data year1996 NCHS ceased collecting detailed marriageand divorce data from the states that had beenproviding unit records. Monthly counts of thenumber of marriages and divorces continue to beobtained from each state. Data and reports from these ﬁles are avail able at the NCHS web site http www.cdc.gov nchs nvss.htm. VITAL STATISTICS 1297VITAL STATISTICS MEASURES The vital statistics system provides counts of the number of times speciﬁed vital events have oc curred.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2310,These counts are useful in themselves. Forexample the numbers of births and deaths areused in the estimation of population size. For mostpurposes however other statistical measures areneeded. For example comparisons of births inone place with those in another requires informa tion on the population size of each area. Thesimplest and cleanest method of making suchcomparisons is to compute rates that relate theevents to the population exposed to the risk of theevent e.g.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2311,the number of births to the number ofwomen of child bearing age . Many types of relative numbers are used in the analysis of vital statistics. Those used most fre quently in the United States are listed below. Thereader can ﬁnd additional information about thedeﬁnition and computation of these statistics inthe works of Weeks 1996 Shryock and Siegel 1976 or Pollard et al. 1991 . Crude rates. The number of events in a given time period divided by the population at riskproduces crude rates.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2312,The result is multiplied by aconstant typically 1 000 or 100 000 for ease ofpresentation. Common crude rates include birth death marriage and divorce. Speciﬁc rates. Crude rates may be limited to a speciﬁc group such as deaths from a speciﬁedcause or in a speciﬁc age group or births tounmarried women. Age adjusted rates.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2313,Age adjustment is a tech nique used to eliminate the effect of the agedistribution of the population on mortality rates.Since the frequency of death varies with age ameasure free of the inﬂuences of population com position is needed to make comparisons betweenareas or over time. Infant mortality rates. Infant mortality rates reﬂect the risk of deaths to infants under the age ofone year.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2314,For infant deaths the most commonlyused estimate of the population at risk denomina tor is the number of live births during the period. Life tables and life expectancy. A life table is used to measure the effect of mortality on longev ity. It shows the mortality experience of a hypo thetical group of infants born at the same time andsubject to the mortality rates of a speciﬁc popula tion group. A life table provides numerous statis tics perhaps the most widely used is life expec tancy at birth.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2315,INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASES Causes of death are classiﬁed for purposes of statistical tabulation according to the International Classiﬁcation of Diseases ICD which is published by the World Health Organization. Traditionally a single cause of death is selected for statisticaltabulations. When the certifying physician indi cates that more than one cause contributed todeath a procedure is required for selecting thesingle cause to be tabulated.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2316,The ICD provides thebasic ground rules used to code and classify causesof death to identify the underlying cause of death and to compensate for inconsistencies in the re ported cause of death statement. It also includesdeﬁnitions of terms such as underlying cause of death live birth maternal death as well as tabulation lists which deﬁne the cause of deathgroupings to be used for international compari sons.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2317,The ICD delineates the format of the medi cal certiﬁcation of death and speciﬁc regulationsregarding the compilation and publication of sta tistics on diseases and causes of death. VITAL STATISTICS AND THE PRACTICE OF PUBLIC HEALTH Over several centuries of development the vital registration system in the United States has evolvedinto the primary source of fundamental publichealth information.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2318,Data on deaths especiallycauses of death have been critical for identifying tracking and eventually understanding and con trolling epidemics of communicable diseases.Today mortality data are used to study trends anddifferentials in all kinds of causes of death bothchronic and communicable as well as those due tohomicide suicide and unintentional injuries.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2319,Infantmortality has traditionally served as a key indicatorof general health conditions in a given population.The availability of mortality statistics for smallgeographic units such as counties has contrib uted uniquely to the value of these data forepidemiologic investigations and surveillance. VLDL CHOLESTEROL 1298Statistics obtained from birth certiﬁcates fetal death reports and the linked birth infant deathﬁle provide a wealth of information about infanthealth.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2320,Statistics on birth weight length of gesta tion smoking during pregnancy access to prena tal care complications of labor and or delivery and obstetric procedures are monitored by healthcare providers and epidemiologists specializing ininfant and child health. In the arena of public policy vital statistics also provide fundamental information. For exam ple teen pregnancy and nonmarital childbearing are topics of continuing interest in national wel fare policy.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2321,Similarly national health policy is verymuch concerned with the problem of health dis parities among various race and ethnic groups. Inthese and many other important policy issues thevital statistics system constitutes a frontline sourceof information that leads to action programs yieldsindicators of effectiveness and generally guidesthe practice of public health.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2322,Vital statistics are one of the few data systems that are generally available throughout the world.The United Nations and the World Health Organi zation have led efforts to standardize registrationpractices deﬁnitions and statistical measurement.Most countries have at least a rudimentary vitalstatistics system and while there are inter countryvariations countries generally adhere to similarregistration principles and statistical measures.These data are widely used to make internationalcomparisons of life expectancy cause speciﬁc mor tality infant deaths and other important meas ures.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2323,Vital statistics are also used for monitoringpopulation growth through measures such as to tal fertility rates. The United Nations publishesmany international vital statistics comparisons inits Demographic Yearbook .

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2332,Public health has been deﬁned by theInstitute of Medicine as what we as a society docollectively to assure the conditions in which peo ple can be healthy. Using this deﬁnition war isclearly antithetical to public health. It not onlycauses death and disability among military person nel and civilians but it also destroys the social economic and political infrastructure necessaryfor well being and health. War violates basic hu man rights.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2333,As a violent method of settling con ﬂicts it promotes other forms of violence in thecommunity and the home. War causes immediateand long term damage to the environment. Andwar and preparation for war sap human and eco nomic resources that might be used for social good. DIRECT IMPACT ON HUMANS AND THE ENVIRONMENT Worldwide there were over 45 million deaths among military personnel during the twentiethcentury a mean annual military death rate of 183deaths per 1 million population.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2334,This rate wasmore than sixteen times greater than the reportedrate for the nineteenth century despite enormousprogress in surgical treatment of war injuries andin the prevention and treatment of infectious dis eases. In addition since an increasing percentageof wars are civil wars or are indiscriminate in theuse of weapons civilians are increasingly caught inthe crossﬁre.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2335,Civilian deaths as a percentage of allwar related deaths rose from 14 percent duringWorld War I to 90 percent during some wars of the 1990s. Moreover during civil wars civilians mayﬁnd it difﬁcult to receive medical care and may beunable to obtain adequate and safe food andwater shelter medicinal care and public healthservices. The physical mental and social impactsof war on civilians are especially severe for vulner able populations including women children theelderly the ill and the disabled.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2336,Further war isresponsible for many million refugees and inter nally displaced persons. INDIRECT IMPACTS ON HUMANS AND THE ENVIRONMENT War also has a severe indirect impact on humans and the environment through the diversion of human and economic resources. The governmentsof many developing countries spend ﬁve to twen ty ﬁve times more on military than on health ex penditures. From this culture of violence peoplelearn at an early age that violence is the way to tryto resolve conﬂicts.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2337,War and preparation for waruse huge amounts of nonrenewable resources such as fossil fuels as well as toxic and radioactivesubstances that cause pollution of the air water and land. INDISCRIMINATE HARM TO NONCOMBATANTS Of particular concern to public health is the indis criminate harm done to noncombatants. This in cludes not only the use of so called weapons of WAR 1302mass destruction such as nuclear chemical and biological weapons but also some uses of conven tional weapons.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2338,Examples of the latter include thecarpet bombing of Warsaw Rotterdam Coventry Dresden Hamburg Tokyo and other cities dur ing World War II and collateral damage caused bybombs and missiles in recent conﬂicts in Iraq Serbia and Kosovo. Anti personnel land minesalso cause indiscriminate injury and death and like biological and chemical weapons have beenbanned by international convention. Chemical and biological weapons have been used since antiquity.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2339,Chemical weapons which areused to produce toxic effects rather than explo sions or ﬁre include vesicant agents such as mus tard gas agents producing pulmonary edema suchas chlorine and phosgene agents affecting oxidiz ing enzymes such as cyanide and anticholinesteraseinhibitors known as nerve agents. Chemical weap ons were used extensively in World War I lead ing to the negotiation of the Geneva Protocolof 1925 which banned the use of chemical andbacteriologic weapons.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2340,During World War II chemical weapons were stockpiled by several na tions but were little used. The Chemical Weapons Convention CWC which was opened for sig nature in 1993 and entered into force in 1997 bans the development production transfer anduse of chemical weapons. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons OPCW headquartered in The Hague has broad enforce ment powers under the CWC.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2341,The United Statesand Russia are proceeding with destruction ofstockpiles of chemical weapons but there remainscontroversy about the health consequences of themethods being used. In 1995 the Aum Shinrikyosect in Japan released nerve agent gas in the Tokyosubway resulting in a number of deaths and manyinjuries. This incident heightened the concernabout future use of chemical weapons.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2342,Biological weapons which are used to cause disease in living organisms were developed and stockpiled by the United States Great Britain and other nations during World War II but saw onlyvery limited use by Japan in China. In 1969 theUnited States unilaterally renounced the use ofbiological weapons and announced the destruc tion of its stockpiles. The Biologic Weapons Con vention BWC which was opened for signature in1972 and entered into force in 1975 is muchweaker than the CWC.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2343,It permits defensive re search which has led to suspicion that offensiveresearch and development is being done. Effortsare currently being made to strengthen the BWC.Concern has recently been raised about the possi ble use of biological agents by groups or individu als to attack civilian populations.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2344,The Anti Personnel Landmine Convention ALC was opened for signature in 1997 and en tered into force in 1999 setting precedents bothfor the speed of its ratiﬁcation and for the workof nongovernmental organizations in bringing itabout. The International Campaign to BanLandmines and its leader Jody Williams wereawarded the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2345,By February2000 the ALC had been signed by 137 govern ments but not by the United States Russia and theother states of the former USSR and most coun tries of the Middle East. The ALC in addition tobanning any further production or placement ofmines calls for destroying stockpiles removingmines from the ground and helping landminesurvivors. Nuclear weapons were used by the United States in 1945 to destroy the Japanese cities ofHiroshima and Nagasaki.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2346,In each city a bomb ofexplosive power equivalent to about 15 kilotons ofTNT caused approximately 100 000 deaths within the ﬁrst few days. Nuclear weapons have not been used in war since but enormous quantities ofnuclear and thermonuclear weapons have beenstockpiled by the United States and the SovietUnion. Explosive tests of these weapons have beenconducted by these two nations and by the UnitedKingdom France China South Africa and in1998 India and Pakistan.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2347,There have been 518tests documented in the atmosphere under water or in space and after the signing of the 1963Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty approximately1 500 tests underground. The U.S. National Can cer Institute estimated in 1997 that the release ofIodine 131 in fallout from U.S. atmospheric nu clear test explosions was responsible for 49 000excess cases of thyroid cancer among U.S. resi dents.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2348,Another study estimated that radioactive fallout from nuclear test explosions would be re sponsible for 430 000 cancer deaths by the year2000. A Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty was nego tiated in 1997 but a number of nations includingthe United States have refused to ratify it. WAR 1303There are now approximately 35 000 nuclear weapons stockpiled in the seven nations that havedeclared possession the U.S. Russia the UnitedKingdom France China India and Pakistan.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2349,Israelis also widely believed to possess nuclear weapons.The declared nuclear weapons nations agreed inthe 1970 Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty NPT to work toward elimination of these weapons butprogress has been slow. The International Court of Justice in a unanimous advisory opinion in 1996ruled that the nuclear weapons states were obli gated under the NPT to pursue in good faith . . .negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2350,TheInternational Physicians for the Prevention ofNuclear War was awarded the 1985 Nobel PeacePrize for its work to reduce the risk of nuclearweapons use by the United States and the SovietUnion. With the dissolution of the USSR there hasalso been concern about leakage of nuclear weap ons to other nations to groups and even toindividuals. THE ROLE OF HEALTH WORKERS AND ORGANIZATIONS Physicians nurses and other health care person nel clearly have an ethical duty to care for thevictims of war.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2351,But medical and public health workers many believe also have an ethical duty to prevent war and its consequences. Since member ship in the armed forces of a nation seems to implyparticipation in a war effort the question ariseswhether medical and public health personnel canethically play such a military role.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2352,Alternate ways for medical and public health workers to care for the casualties of war are avail able through organizations such as the Interna tional Red Cross Doctors Without Borders whichreceived the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize and Doctorsof the World as well as various associations thatseek to alleviate the causes of war and to promotenonviolent conﬂict resolution.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2353,Such associationsinclude the American Public Health Association Physicians for Social Responsibility Physicians forHuman Rights the International Physicians forthe Prevention of Nuclear War and AmnestyInternational. Public health professionals can help to reduce and eliminate the causes of war such as discrimi nation poverty and disease.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2354,They can educateand raise awareness about the health and social consequences of war and preparation for war establish surveillance systems to detect wars or thecircumstances that lead to war at an early stage advocate for policies and treaties to ban weaponsof indiscriminate destruction encourage and sup port mediation and other forms of nonviolentconﬂict resolution and work with all groups insociety to promote a culture of peace.

WASTEWATER TREATMENT Water containing human waste and excreta is generally termed wastewater. Usually wastewaterconsists of 99.9 percent water and 0.1 percentwaste. In the United States each state has a lawthat requires the disposal of human waste in asanitary manner.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2361,Treatment of wastewater is re quired to prevent the pollution of surface waters the pollution of groundwater and to prevent patho genic and microbial contamination from the useof excreta as fertilizer. Also wastewater should bedisposed of in a sanitary manner to make it inac cessible to insects that transmit disease. Wastewater treatment consists of physical chemical and biological processes either aero bic or anaerobic. The aerobic process is used mostfrequently.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2362,In the activated sludge process air hasto be forced into the liquid in a tank that is used tomaintain aerobic microbial activity and to preventodor. Additionally temperature and pH must bemaintained for the microbial activity. In a municipal system the ﬂow moves as fol lows from sanitary sewer to screening and grind ing process to primary clariﬁcation to activatedsludge or trickling ﬁlter to secondary clariﬁca tion to chlorine treatment and ﬁnally to a waterbody such as a river or stream.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2363,Wastewater fromthe home enters a domestic or sanitary sewer asystem of pipes that collect the wastewater. Thewaste is then transported to a wastewater treat ment plant. As it enters the plant it ﬂows througha bar screen which strains out large materials. Itthen continues into a grit basin or chamber wherethe water is slowed down enough to allow heavy ordense particles to settle out. These particles arethen removed and taken to a landﬁll.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2364,The materi als that do not settle out are ground up to preparethem to be digested by microorganisms in thetreatment plant. The wastewater then enters the primary clari ﬁer which allows materials to settle out. The ﬂowof water through the clariﬁer is slow allowinglarge amounts of suspended solids to settle at thebottom in the form of sludge. The sludge is thenscraped and pumped away to allow the process tocontinue.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2365,From the primary clariﬁer the wastewater enters activated sludge tanks or trickling ﬁlters.Trickling ﬁlters are large areas of biological de composition consisting of rocks that host biologi cal organisms on their surfaces. These organismsmetabolize most of the suspended solids that didnot settle in the primary clariﬁer. The buildup onthese rocks eventually sloughs off. The activatedsludge tank is also used to remove waste from thewastewater.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2366,In this process water from the pri mary clariﬁer is pumped into an aeration tank andcombined with a mixture rich in bacterial growth.Pure oxygen is pumped through allowing thedecomposition of the organic materials in thewastewater. The remaining water is moved fromthe top of the tank leaving sludge at the bottom. Water from the trickling ﬁlter moves to a secondary clariﬁer which settles any remainingsuspended solids.

WATER POLLUTION See Ambient Water Quality WATER QUALITY Water quality is a technical term that is based upon the characteristics of water in relation toguideline values of what is suitable for humanconsumption and for all usual domestic purposes including personal hygiene. Components of waterquality include microbial biological chemical andphysical aspects. Microbial Aspects. Drinking water should not include microorganisms that are known to bepathogenic.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2369,It should also not contain bacteriathat would indicate excremental pollution theprimary indicator of which are coliform bacteria that are present in the feces of warm blooded organisms. Chlorine is the usual disinfectant as itis readily available and inexpensive. Unfortunately it is not fully effective as currently used against allorganisms. Biological Aspects.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2370,Parasitic protozoa and helminths are also indicators of water quality.Species of protozoa can be introduced into watersupply through human or animal fecal contamina tion. Most common among the pathogenic proto zoans are Entamoeba and Giardia . Coliforms are not appropriate direct indicators because of thegreater resistance of these protozoans to inactiva tion by disinfection.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2371,Drinking water sources thatare not likely to be contaminated by fecal mattershould be used where possible due to the lackof good indicators for the presence or absenceof pathogenic protozoa. A single mature larvaor fertilized egg of parasitic roundworms andﬂatworms can cause infection when transmitted tohumans through drinking water. The measures currently available for the detection of helminthsin drinking water are not suitable for routine use. Chemical Aspects.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2372,Chemical contamination of water sources may be due to certain industriesand agricultural practices or from natural sources.When toxic chemicals are present in drinkingwater there is the potential that they may causeeither acute or chronic health effects. Chronichealth effects are more common than acute effectsbecause the levels of chemicals in drinking waterare seldom high enough to cause acute healtheffects.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2373,Since there is limited evidence relatingchronic human health conditions to speciﬁc drink ing water contaminants laboratory animal studiesand human data from clinical reports are used topredict adverse effects. Physical Aspects. The turbidity color taste and odor of water can be monitored. Turbidityshould always be low especially where disinfectionis practiced. High turbidity can inhibit the effectsof disinfection against microorganisms and enablebacterial growth.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2374,Drinking water should be color less since drinking water coloration may be due tothe presence of colored organic matter. Organicsubstances also cause water odor though odorsmay result from many factors including biologicalactivity and industrial pollution. Taste problemsrelating to water could be indicators of changes inwater sources or treatment process.

It is important that thereused water comply with all federal state andlocal laws and regulations.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2377,Some of the possibleapplications for the reuse of wastewater includeindustrial applications landscape irrigation agri cultural irrigation aesthetic uses such as foun tains in parks or cities and ﬁre suppression. Several factors must be considered in any wastewater reuse program including the qualityof the water needed for the application the identi ﬁcation of the wastewater source that meets thisquality level and the very practical needs of trans porting this water to its new use.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2378,The practical beneﬁt of wastewater reuse or reclaimed water is that it reduces the need forsurface water or groundwater. The reuse of waterprovides for conservation of new potable watersources as well as elimination of the need to ex pand treatment and processing facilities. Water recycling is a part of water reuse. Recy cling of water is the reuse of water for the sameapplication for which it was originally used. Insome cases the recycled water requires treatmentbefore it can be used again.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2379,The factors to beconsidered in a water recycling program are simi lar to the ones listed above for wastewater reuse. Avery common example of water recycling is thecirculation of cooling water. This represents a verylarge use of water in the United States. Water ispassed through a system to lower the temperatureof a heat source then the water is discharged. Recycling the water via a recirculating cooling system can greatly reduce water use and stillperform the cooling operation required.

Sedimentation allows any coarse particles to settle out.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2382,Coagulation consists of forming ﬂoccu lent particles in a liquid by adding a chemicalsuch as alum these particles then settle to thebottom. Filtration as the name implies is thepassing of the water through a porous media the amount of removal is a function of the ﬁl tering media. Disinfection kills most harmful or ganisms and pathogenic bacteria chlorine is themost commonly used disinfecting agent. Soften ing means removal of materials that cause hard ness such as calcium and magnesium.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2383,Corrosionis an electrochemical reaction in which metal dete riorates when it comes in contact with air wa ter or soil. In a typical municipal water treatment proc ess water ﬂows through pumps to a rapid mixbasin then to a ﬂocculation basin to a settlingbasin through ﬁlters to a clear well then afterdisinfection to storage tanks and ﬁnally to theend users. In areas that derive their water from rivers pumps must be used since rivers are usually in lowareas.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2385,The water then slowlyﬂows through settling basins where the ﬂoc settlesfrom the water. Activated carbon is then added tothe water to remove color radioactivity taste andodor. Filtration then removes bacteria and turbid ity from the water as it removes any remainingsuspended solids and the activated carbon. The water then enters a clear well where additional chlorine is added to kill any pathogenswhich may be present.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2386,A minimum free chlorineresidual of at least 0.2 ppm is recommended inplants requiring sanitary protection through thewhole water distribution system. In water suppliesthat are ﬂuoridated 1 milligram per liter of ﬂuo ride is added. At this stage in the process the water is pota ble palatable and ready for consumption. Thewater is moved into elevated tanks for storagethrough pumps. The water ﬂows down from thesetanks into the community.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2387,Raw water and post treatment water are tested for bacterial physical and chemical standards particularly pH color and turbidity. The SafeDrinking Water Act of 1974 established maximumcontaminant levels which are the national drink ing water standards. These apply to any waterdistribution system that serves at least twenty ﬁveunits daily. Standards may vary from state to state but they cannot be lower than those prescribed bythe federal government.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2389,WATERBORNE DISEASES An adult human needs to drink at least 1.5 liters of water a day to replace ﬂuid lost in urine sweat andrespired air and to perform essential biochemical functions. Moreover almost 90 percent of bodymass is water. Water however can also carrydangerous pathogens and toxic chemicals into thebody. The catalogue of waterborne pathogens islong and it includes many that are well known aswell as far larger numbers of more obscure or ganisms. Waterborne pathogens include viruses e.g.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2390,hepatitis A poliomyelitis bacteria e.g. chol era typhoid coliform organisms protozoa e.g. cryptosporidiosum amebae giardia worms e.g. schistosomia guinea worm and toxins e.g. arse nic cadmium numerous organic chemicals . Water also harbors the intermediate stages of many parasites either as free living larvae or insome other form and it is the vehicle for essentialstages in the life cycle of many dangerous insectvectors notably mosquitoes and blackﬂies.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2391,Chemical contamination or pollution of drink ing water is another serious problem one thathas become a great deal worse in the modernindustrial era due to the widespread and oftenunregulated discharge of toxic substances intorivers lakes and oceans. For practical purposes this discussion of waterborne diseases and their control focusesmainly on the pathogenic organisms for whichwater is a common vehicle.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2392,It is important to notethat not only drinking water but also water usedfor cleaning fruit vegetables and cooking uten sils and for washing can convey disease. Indeed salads that have been washed in polluted water area frequently overlooked and rather common sourceof waterborne disease responsible for an occa sional outbreak of cholera or typhoid.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2393,Water sources springs rivers lakes ponds streams wells reservoirs and rainwater runoffinto tanks and cisterns can all be contaminated by fecal matter of human or animal origin. Organic matter of other origin dead animals decayingvegetation can contaminate drinking water too in ways that range from very dangerous to merelyunpleasant. Water from suspect sources usually can be made safe to drink by boiling.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2394,Ancient empiricalobservation of this fact in India and China mayhave led to the popularity in those countries ofdrinking tea and other infusions made with boilingwater. However boiling is neither practical nor WELL BABY CLINICS 1308sensible for the treatment of large municipal water supplies. These must be protected by appropriatetreatment measures ﬁltration and puriﬁcation generally through chlorination that were devel oped mainly in the nineteenth century in theindustrial nations.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2395,Provision of safe drinking watersupplies has been among the most effective andimportant measures ever taken to advance thepublic s health. The other essential components in the preven tion of waterborne diseases are the sanitary dis posal of sewage and the environmental control oftoxic chemicals. Sanitary services are based onsewage disposal systems in most organized urbancommunities.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2396,Some rapidly growing suburban de velopments may lack adequate sanitation duringtheir early stages but local regulations usuallyprohibit occupancy until sanitation is installed andworking. In rural regions and other sparsely set tled localities including campgrounds humanwaste is often disposed of in septic tanks or pitprivies.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2397,The combination of sanitary disposal ofhuman sewage and the provision of safe watersupplies has virtually eliminated many of the seri ous waterborne epidemic diseases that took such aheavy toll of life until the early years of the twenti eth century. However sanitary services break downwhen ﬂoods earthquakes and other disasters oc cur and at such times it is essential to boil water toensure that pathogens are killed.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2398,Other methods such as the use of iodine or chloramine in tablet orpowder form are sometimes used both underemergency conditions and by backpackers and thelike but these methods are less effective thanboiling. Even with the best protective measures how ever there are occasional serious large waterborneepidemics and innumerable small ones.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2399,Recentlarge epidemics include the 1993 outbreak ofcryptosporidiosis in Wisconsin which affectedabout 400 000 people and several lethal outbreaksof E. coli 0157 H7 infection which is very danger ous because it causes kidney damage that can befatal. Both these and other waterborne diseasesare often due to pollution of public drinking watersupplies by animal waste.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2400,Modern factory farmingmethods generate enormous quantities of ma nure and after heavy rains it is easy for runoff con taminated with animal manure to enter the watersupply. Animal manure can contain the dangerousE. coli 0157 H7 strain. Even frequent testing canfail to detect evidence of pollution in time to prevent serious waterborne outbreaks. When test ing laboratories have suffered budget cuts thestaff is often downsized making waterborne dis ease outbreaks more likely.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2401,Several recent out breaks in the United States and Canada are di rectly attributable to this sequence of events. Chemical pollution of water supplies presents problems of a different kind. Chemical contamina tion can cause acute illnesses but more often thetoxic contaminants are slow poisons such as car cinogens and the effects may be manifest in only asmall proportion of all those who are exposed.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2402,Thepollution can come to light when a cluster of casesof leukemia or some unusual variety of cancer orother illness is detected in a community as inWoburn Massachusetts where ethylene chloridethat had leeched into the soil contaminated ground water that fed several wells. Municipal water supplies should be routinely monitored by frequent bacteriological and chemi cal testing.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2403,Bacteriological testing focuses oncoliform organisms that if present are not onlyharmful in themselves but also are a marker forother varieties of fecal contamination. Chemicalpollution presents a more difﬁcult problem be cause of the wide variety of chemicals that canpollute a water supply.

As public health clinics sup ported by tax dollars they provide a safety net forthe economically disadvantaged by offering low cost health care. The clinics operate on a sliding fee scale or they may give free care to familiesunable to pay.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2405,One of the important services offered by well baby clinics is the provision of immunizations forchildhood diseases such as diphtheria pertussis tetanus polio Haemophilus inﬂuenzae type b hepa titis B measles mumps rubella and varicella. The WELLNESS BEHAVIOR 1309clinics are responsible for tracking immunization rates in the community and notifying familieswhen shots are due.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2406,Families frequently ask why their children need routine health care when they have already re ceived all of their required immunizations. Theanswer is simply that well child clinics provide anarray of diagnostic and preventative services.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2412,It is of course not sosimple. Western medicine shaped by physicians has dominated health care in the United Statesduring the past century. Most physicians are re markably service oriented people who want noth ing more than to make people healthy. However they are trained in curing disease not enhancinghealth. As a result health care systems focus oncuring disease rather than promoting health andpreventing disease.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2413,Hospitals are able to trans plant vital organs create new skin for people withburns covering a majority of their bodies reattachsevered limbs and perform other equally miracu lous procedures. Unfortunately they do an inade quate job of keeping people healthy. This focus is changing however. During the second half of the twentieth century a body ofresearch began to emerge that provides compell ing evidence that lifestyle choices make a differ ence between health and disease and between lifeand death.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2414,Michael McGinnis and William Foegehave calculated that half the deaths in the UnitedStates are caused by lifestyle related behaviors.Their work and that of others has shown that over400 000 deaths could be saved by eliminating smok ing over 300 000 through regular exercise andgood nutrition 100 000 by responsible use ofalcohol 35 000 by eliminating ﬁrearms 30 000through safe sex practices 25 000 by safer driving and 20 000 by eliminating drug abuse.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2415,To putthese numbers in perspective tobacco causes moredeaths in the United States each year than all theforeign wars in the nation s history. Lifestyle fac tors contribute to all of the top ﬁfteen diseases thatcause deaths in the United States. QUALITY OF LIFE Wellness is certainly not just avoiding death so counting the number of deaths that healthful life styles could save tells only part of the story.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2416,Practic ing these behaviors also improves quality of life in WELLNESS BEHAVIOR 1310terms of having more energy fewer aches and pains better sex and enhanced self esteem. Suchelements of health are more difﬁcult to measure so most scientists focus their research on objectivemeasures such as death and disease. There is some controversy in the interpreta tion of much of the available data especially in theareas of obesity and nutrition.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2417,For example Jere miah Stamler estimates that obesity alone causes240 000 to 380 000 deaths each year while StevenBlair argues that lack of exercise not obesity per se is the more important risk factor. There are alsoarguments about the amount of alcohol that isoptimal.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2418,After decades of debate many scientistsnow believe that up to four glasses of beer or wineper week may actually be more healthful thancomplete abstention from alcohol for those whoare not alcoholics and do not suffer from condi tions that can be aggravated by alcohol. The gen eral public is also often confused by reports aboutthe healthfulness of speciﬁc diets. Is butter ormargarine more healthy Is beta carotene good orbad In fact factors at this level of detail have onlya minimal impact on health.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2419,The death rate in theUnited States and most developed countries couldbe cut in half if all people could be persuaded tonot use tobacco or illegal drugs to use alcohol inmoderation or not at all exercise on a regularbasis always wear a seat belt when driving neverdrink and drive not use ﬁrearms get plenty ofsleep practice safe sex and eat a diet high invegetables fruits and whole grains and low in fat sodium and sugar.

SOCIAL FACTORS The data gets more complex when other nations of the world are examined. It is safe to say thatapproximately half the deaths in developed na tions of the world and possibly one third or moreof the deaths in developing nations are caused bylifestyle related problems.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2421,Nevertheless the smok ing rate and consumption rate of high fat foods ishigher in some European nations though the rateof heart disease is much lower than in the UnitedStates and very low rates of heart disease arefound in Asian nations like Japan and Korea de spite very high rates of smoking.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2422,Within the United States people from His panic backgrounds tend to have lower rates of child mortality than people from other cultures even among those who have similar income levelsand health habits. The common characteristic ofall of those groups is strong social connectionsthrough extended family and networks of friends. Findings like these are beginning to make scientists speculate that social factors are veryimportant in determining a person s health.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2423,Atleast three elements of our social environmentimpact our health. In 1980 Robert F. Allen ex plained the importance of people s peers in shap ing health behaviors as well as the futility of tryingto change health and other behaviors withoutchanging the norms of the group. For example most children start smoking cigarettes and drink ing alcohol through the inﬂuence of their friends and when they quit they often lose those friendswho choose to continue.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2424,Most people who exer cise as adults started when they were kids and theyoften did so to be involved in neighborhood or school sports to be with their friends. The work of Barbara Israel Kenneth McLeroy Michael Marmot and others has shown the protec tive effect that social support provided by socialnetworks of family and friends can have on help ing avoid problems that can threaten health aswell as the effect social factors have in helpingpeople recover from illness more quickly.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2425,In hispopular book Love and Survival Dean Ornish reviewed scientiﬁc literature that showed that menwho feel loved by their wives adults who had warmrelationships with their parents and people whohave a warm integrated community of friends allhave lower rates of disease and death. This workhas led Ornish to speculate that social factors maybe as important as physical factors in determiningoverall health.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2426,Finally work by Michael Marmotand others has shown that socioeconomic status both in absolute and relative terms has a verysigniﬁcant impact on health. Can people change the social factors in their lives They cannot choose their parents or siblings and birth circumstances often dictate socioeco nomic status. However people can choose their WIDOWHOOD 1311spouse and they do have an inﬂuence on their children.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2427,They can also choose their friends and through diligent effort can work to shape thenorms of friends organizations and communitiesto inﬂuence health in a positive way. This is however a formidable task. So wellness behavior might not be the right term. Wellness lifestyle may be a more accurateterm but striving for optimal health expressesthe complex set of social and behavioral factorsthat impact health much better.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2428,OPTIMAL HEALTH Inspired by the work of Bill Hettler and recogniz ing the scope and complexity of all the factors thatimpact health the American Journal of Health Pro motion has suggested that people think in terms of optimal health and the factors that impact optimalhealth. Optimal health may be deﬁned as a bal ance of physical emotional social spiritual andintellectual health.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2429,Spiritual health includes hav ing a sense of purpose in life the ability to give andreceive love and feeling goodwill and charity to ward others. Intellectual health is related to learn ing and achievements in life which can occurthrough school work hobbies community ser vice or cultural pursuits. Emotional health refersto one s mental state of being and encompassesthe stresses in a person s life how one reacts tothose stresses and the ability to relax and enjoyleisure.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2430,Rather than strive for excellence in anyone area people can best achieve a state of healthby striving to achieve balance in these ﬁve areas. Behavior alone is not the sole determinant of lifestyle a person s environment and opportuni ties also play major roles in health. People mayfocus on different areas of optimal health as theypass through different stages in their lives becauseachieving optimal health is a lifelong process.

Further while mostolder widowed people do not remarry widowershave remarriage rates over eight times as high asthose of widows. Different societies attach very different cus toms and values to widowhood and these havea strong inﬂuence on how it is experienced.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2437,Mostwidows go through an intense grieving processearly in widowhood marked by feelings of de pression mood changes disrupted sleep patterns obsessive thoughts about the deceased anddisorientation. However the intensity of grief usu ally decreases signiﬁcantly within a year. Many widows and widowers begin to develop newstrengths and talents and remake their social net works to include new friends and contacts. Intensegrief is not required for recovery from widowhood.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2438,CONSEQUENCES OF WIDOWHOOD FOR HEALTH AND WELL BEING Research on the consequences of widowhood for health and mental health is fraught with contradic tory ﬁndings. Early studies found high mortalityrates among widows but recent work has notreplicated these results. One of the biggest prob lems reported by both widows and widowers isloneliness which may last well beyond the usual period of mourning. Symptoms of depression anddecreased life satisfaction may also last for sev eral years.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2439,Widowhood does not appear to worsen health. However it disrupts daily routines especially thoseassociated with food preparation and consump tion. Widowed people commonly report decreasedsocial participation. Among women consequencesof widowhood may include a lower income and inolder age groups increased likelihood of nursinghome placement. One critical factor in how well the surviving spouse copes is the manner of the other spouse sdeath.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2440,Suicide can be devastating for the survivingspouse and accidental death is more traumaticthan death resulting from an illness. However adjustment may also be difﬁcult when the spouse sdeath follows a prolonged condition such as Alz heimer s disease. In general individuals are likelyto cope better if they have had some time toprepare for imminent widowhood but are notexhausted by prolonged or intense caregiving.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2441,A key concept in understanding the impacts of widowhood is that of on time versus off time which refer to the surviving spouse s life stage.Being widowed in later life is on time and can beanticipated. In contrast being widowed in early adulthood is off time and is both unexpected andlikely to entail concurrent stresses such as the grief of dependent children or the loss of themajor source of household income. Men are affected more by widowhood than women.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2442,Widowhood is less likely to be anticipatedby men and men are generally more dependenton their spouse for social and emotional support.A person who is devoted to his or her role as ahusband or wife has a greater adjustment to makewhen widowed than an individual who has othervalued roles. Widowhood may be experienced as a positive transition. It may even come as a relief if themarriage was unhappy or burdensome.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2443,In com parison with married people widowed peopleexpress less strain and a greater capacity to makeplans and carry them out. Widowed individualsadjust better if they are involved in physical activ ity can rely on support from family members WINSLOW CHARLES EDWARD AMORY 1313and friends and can develop new interests and friendships. POLICY AND SERVICE PROVISION Dealing with widowhood has remained largely in the private domain.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2444,Widowed people and theirfamilies are usually left to cope as best they can with little attention from government or serviceproviders. In contrast other transitions commonlyexperienced by older people such as retirementand becoming a caregiver although less stressfuland disruptive have attracted considerable policyattention and service provision.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2445,However most older people have regular con tact with their doctors and general medical practi tioners are in a good position to monitor anyenduring negative impacts of widowhood and to suggest appropriate interventions.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2450,In a period dominated bydiscoveries in bacteriology he recognized the im portance of a broader perspective on causationthan that embraced by the germ theory of disease. For forty years from 1915 to 1945 Winslow was a professor of public health at Yale University.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2459,As recently as the 1980s students in most Western medical schools weretaught that except for issues related directly toreproductive anatomy and function women were medically identical to men. According to this be lief system medical research could be carried outon men and the results could simply be applied towomen. As a result only health care providers whospecialized in areas related to reproduction wereexpected to be knowledgeable about issues par ticular to women.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2460,In order to understand the modern deﬁnition of women s health it is important to understandthe history of how women s health care has beenviewed by the medical and medical research estab lishments. Traditionally the health of women hasbeen seen as synonymous with maternal or repro ductive health. Clearly the Western medical pro fession s view of women s health as maternalhealth was concordant with societal mores thatvalued women mainly for their ability to bearchildren.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2461,However until well into the twentiethcentury the major causes of illness and death inwomen did in fact relate to reproductive issues.Childbirth and sexually transmitted diseases in cluding cervical cancer have been the most impor tant health issues for women in all ages and places except in the West and certain other countries inthe twentieth century. Prior to 1900 the majorityof elderly persons in the United States were men reﬂecting the toll that childbearing took on thehealth of women.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2462,In 1970 the book Our Bodies Ourselves became a touchstone of the women s health movement.Authored by a group of women participating in acourse on health sexuality and childbearing thebook emphasizes the importance of women attain ing knowledge about their health and being activeparticipants in health care in both an individualand societal sense. Our Bodies Ourselves also con siders the social context of health including ef fects of sexism racism and ﬁnancial pressureson the health of women.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2463,Throughout the 1970s major focuses of the women s health movement WOMEN S HEALTH 1315included reproductive freedom understanding health in a broader social context and a criticalorientation toward the medical establishment. In the 1980s women s health advocates began to argue for a broader deﬁnition of women shealth and increased participation of women inresearch studies. A major new focus became chang ing the medical establishment.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2464,The reasons forthis change in orientation particularly toward theparticipation by women in research studies werecomplex. They included but were not limited to the growing number of women living beyond theirreproductive years and the growing number ofwomen reaching positions of inﬂuence within aca demic medicine.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2465,In 1983 the United States Public Health Ser vice commissioned a task force on women s health.This task force broadly deﬁned women s healthissues to include not only reproductive and socialissues but also biological differences between men and women. The modern ﬁeld of women s healthincludes the study of illnesses and conditions that are unique to women more common or serious inwomen have distinct causes or manifestations inwomen or have different outcomes or treatmentsin women.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2466,Since the 1980s research on genderdifferences in health and disease has had impor tant implications for the treatment and preventionof a variety of common serious illnesses includingheart disease stroke lung cancer depression co lon cancer and dementia. Research in all theseareas is ongoing. Integral to this new expanded view of women s health has been a change in how medical researchhas been viewed by the public.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2467,In the 1970s thefocus of women s health advocates in the UnitedStates was on protecting women from potential abuses by seeking to avoid their inclusion in medi cal research studies. It should be noted that womenwere excluded from medical research during thistime because of a variety of factors and not solely or even mainly because of popular advocacy.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2468,Medi cal research was conducted almost exclusively bymale physicians and because most research scien tists believed that effects of the reproductive cycleof women might lead to unreliable research re sults most supported the belief that research shouldbe conducted on men and then applied to women.Even most medical research on rats during thisperiod was conducted using male rats.However by the 1980s women s health advo cates had realized that because women were beingexcluded from research studies knowledge aboutthe diagnosis and treatment of a wide variety ofcommon diseases in women lagged far behindknowledge of diseases in men.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2469,A major focus ofthe women s health movement in the 1980s and1990s was improving knowledge about disease inwomen by promoting the inclusion of women inresearch studies mainly through mandating inclu sion of women in federally funded research studies. A greater understanding of the factors inﬂu encing women s health from a biological perspec tive has been paralleled by a greater understand ing of the psychosocial and societal factors thataffect women s health status.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2470,As an example re search published in the early 1990s showed thatbecause women were more likely than men torequire ongoing rather than episodic treatmentfor their health conditions federally sponsoredinsurance in the United States Medicare actuallycovered less overall health costs for women thanfor men. Differences in employment patterns alsoresult in fewer women being medically insuredthan men strongly affecting access to health careand health status.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2471,Research on domestic violence which disproportionately victimizes women un derlined the short and long term health effects ofwhat had previously been considered either anonissue or a law enforcement issue. Some have suggested that the term women s health be replaced by the term gender basedmedicine in part to reﬂect that medical research that promotes a greater understanding of the ef fect of gender on health beneﬁts both womenand men.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2472,However others believe that the term women s health is most accurate since it incor porates not only biomedical issues but also thepsychosocial and societal factors that ultimatelyinﬂuence the overall health status of women. The ﬁeld of women s health seeks to promote an understanding of the biological and psychosocialfactor affecting women s health and to integratethis understanding into public health initiatives including training of health care providers.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2473,Recog nition by the medical research establishment ofthe need to study health and disease in women aswell as men has been essential to this new para digm.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2477,Together these two elements form a worksitetobacco control program.Worksite smoking policies began with an early concern for protection of equipment such as com puters and for employee safety such as thoseworking around natural gas. Following the 1986 Surgeon General s Report on the Health Consequencesof Involuntary Smoking the rate of adoption of restrictive smoking policies increased.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2478,With theclassiﬁcation of ETS as a Group A carcinogen bythe Environmental Protection Agency in 1993 itbecame a major risk and liability issue for worksites. In 1999 79 percent of worksites with ﬁfty or more employees were smoke free or limited smok ing to separately ventilated areas a large increasefrom 27 percent in 1985. All occupational groupsare not equally protected however.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2479,In a 1992 1993national survey blue collar and service workers who have higher smoking rates than that of thetotal population reported a percentage of smoke free worksites well below the national average. Policies that ban smoking are more effective than restrictive policies as they reduce exposureto ETS for all employees. In addition such policiesmay inﬂuence smokers to cut down or quit areeasier to implement and enforce and decreasemaintenance costs.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2480,A secondary effect of restrictive smoking poli cies is their impact on employee smoking behav ior. There is consistent evidence that restrictivepolicies lead to a reduction of cigarettes smoked atwork a median reduction of 3.4 per day in onereview article . The evidence that these policiesinﬂuence smoking employees to quit however isinconclusive.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2481,Researchers have estimated thatsmoke free workplaces are currently responsiblefor a 2 percent decrease in cigarette consumptionin the United States a decrease of 9.7 billioncigarettes and that if all worksites were smoke free a 4.1 percent decrease 20.9 billion ciga rettes would occur. In 1992 40 percent of worksites with ﬁfty or more employees offered smoking cessation pro grams.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2482,The rationale for corporate sponsorship ofsmoke cessation programs has been to decreasehealth care demand and to reduce health carecosts as smokers have been shown to have higherthan average health care costs and to increaseproductivity as smoking has been associated withabsenteeism and reduced productivity.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2483,A recent WORKPLACE SMOKING POLICIES AND PROGRAMS 1317economic analysis using current data for the back ground quit rate participation and cessation ratesof programs absenteeism on the job productiv ity employee turnover rates and the health effectsof smoking showed an average positive cost beneﬁtratio of 1.75 ﬁve years after a program began andincreasing to 8.89 after twenty ﬁve years.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2484,A review of studies evaluating the effective ness of smoking cessation programs between 1968and 1994 found median quit rates for cessationgroups to be 23 percent while those for minimaltreatment programs were 10.1 percent. Competi tions and incentives were found to boost cessationrates although how much was unclear due tomethodological ﬂaws. Comprehensive program ming that included smoking was successful in re ducing smoking in twelve of nineteen studies re viewed.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2485,A meta analysis of long term over twelvemonths cessation rates from twenty controlledcessation trials at worksites found a weighted aver age quit rate of 13 percent with higher rates fromlonger interventions those that used employeetime as well as work time and those in smallerworksites. The worksite provides a unique opportunity to create interventions for the total population ofsmoking employees.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2486,However most cessation pro grams attract only those smokers who are moti vated both to quit and to use the particular format of the program. Thus participation rates are low. Better marketing and tailoring of programs wouldincrease participation. Of particular importance isthe tailoring of programs to different stages ofchange.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2487,Many smokers have no intention to quit orare merely thinking about it these employeesrequire a different intervention one that empha sizes the beneﬁts of quitting and decreases theperceived positive outcomes of smoking and nega tive outcomes of quitting. Media communication through employee newsletters for example is agood format for this and can be part of a compre hensive cessation intervention that reaches smok ers at all stages of change.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2488,To augment worksite programming corpo rate health insurance beneﬁts should include nico tine replacement therapy and other recommendedpharmacotherapy and programs should be coor dinated with managed care providers offerings oftobacco assessment and counseling. Internally physical activity nutrition and stress management programs will assist smokers to quit and to stayabstinent.

WORKSITE DRUG TESTING Because of the growing use of illicit drugs and the abuse of prescription drugs and alcohol in mod ern society an extensive program of worksite drugtesting has developed.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2497,Workers who abuse drugsare much more likely to injure themselves and putfellow workers at risk and many companies nowrequire preemployment drug screening as a toolto keep those who have been abusing drugs out ofthe workplace. Drug testing can be done for theuse of illegal drugs for the abuse of legal drugs forwhich a person does not have an appropriatemedical need and prescription or for abuse ofalcohol.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2498,Not only has the number of companies that use drug screening risen dramatically over theyears but organizations such as the United States Armed Forces also have regularly implementedintake drug testing. Many legal protections guar antee employment in spite of having evidence ofillness but drug abuse is not covered in the sameway and employment may be legally denied forfailure to pass a drug test.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2499,In addition to preemployment drug testing many corporations employ repetitive drug testing and in some work settings such as in the transpor tation area random drug testing may be carriedout for all workers engaged in certain activities.Also when there is an accident in transportation or in many other work settings an immediate post accident drug test is often done. In such instances the results can lead to disciplinary or legal action. Drug testing and evaluation must follow strict legal guidelines.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2500,Specially designated medical ofﬁ cials called Medical Review Ofﬁcers MRP re view results and simply report that an individualhas either passed or failed a drug screen they arebarred from revealing to anyone including thepolice which substance or substances were de tected. Drug testing generally utilizes urine sam ples. However blood tests and hair analysis mayalso be used.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2501,Workers have legal rights with regardto the taking of urine specimens and these aresafeguarded by elaborate collection and handlingprocedures. All personnel involved must conformto rigid guidelines with a proper chain of custody being followed. This means that specimens mustbe obtained under close supervision includingvisual inspection and temperature measurement and put into sealed containers with the personfrom whom the specimen has been taken signingfor it.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2502,Each person handling the specimen mustsign for it along the way. Substance abuse is characterized by either the use of illegal drugs or the used of prescriptiondrugs for which one has no prescription. Initialscreening tests which are relatively insensitive must be further validated by the use of morespeciﬁc and accurate test measurements. Suchsecondary testing must be carried out to verify ordisprove the ﬁndings of the relatively insensitivescreening tests most commonly used.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2519,WHO operations are carried out by three distinct components the World Health Assembly the executive board and the secretariat. The WorldHealth Assembly is the supreme decision makingbody and it meets annually with participation ofministers of health from its 191 member nations.In a real sense the WHO is an international healthcooperative that monitors the state of the world shealth and takes steps to improve the health statusof individual countries and of the world community.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2520,The executive board composed of thirty two individuals chosen on the basis of their scientiﬁcand professional qualiﬁcations meets between theassembly sessions. It implements the decisions andpolicies of the assembly. The secretariat is headed by the director gen eral who is elected by the assembly upon thenomination of the board. The headquarters of theWHO is in Geneva.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2522,There are 141 WHO countryofﬁces and the total number of WHO staff as of2001 stands at 3 800. WHO is the only agency ofthe UN system with such a decentralized structure.The Pan American Health Organization PAHO existed before the birth of WHO and serves asWHO s regional ofﬁce for the Americas.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2523,The founding fathers of the UN purposely set aside a network of specialized agencies with theirown assemblies intending that technical coopera tion among member states would be free of thepolitical considerations of the UN itself. It has notalways worked out this way however. WHO couldnot escape entirely the political ﬁghts that oc curred in the specialized agencies and the assem bly s deliberations have often reﬂected the politi cal currents of the time.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2524,The decentralized structure of WHO has added a political dimension that has its pluses and minuses.Many of the resources are assigned to the regionalcenters which better reﬂect regional interests. Onthe other hand the regional directors as electedofﬁcials can act quite independently and occa sionally they do. This has given rise to the impres sion that there are several WHOs. Moreover because the regional directors are elected they need to give consideration to therequirements of reelection.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2525,Since the regional di rectors choose country representatives in theirregions the dynamics of personnel interaction inWHO s administration is quite unique in the UNsystem. Regional control over country ofﬁces isstrong leaving the WHO country representativeswith limited authority or leeway for programimplementation. ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND CHALLENGES The second half of the twentieth century saw remarkable gains in global health spurred by rapideconomic growth and unprecedented scientiﬁcadvances.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2526,WHO has played a very pivotal role insetting health policies as well as providing techni cal cooperation to its member states. Life expec tancy rose from 48 years in 1955 to 69 years in1985. During the same period the infant mortalityrate fell from 148 per 1000 live births to below 59per 1000. Population growth has been sloweddramatically in many of the most populous coun tries. Smallpox the ancient scourge has disap peared. Other successes include the control oflice borne typhus and yaws.

One out ofﬁve persons in the world has no access to safedrinking water. Infectious diseases alone accountfor 13 million deaths a year most of them in thedeveloping countries. Seventy percent of the poorare women. The chance of an expectant mother inthe world s poorest country dying of childbirth is500 times greater than her counterpart in therichest country.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2529,Excessive consumption and pollution prac tices have produced profound climatic changesthat impact on the environment and the health ofhuman beings. Globalization of trade and market ing has led to a sharp increase in the use oftobacco alcohol and high fat foods along withunhealthy lifestyles. THE EARLY YEARS OF WHO Initially WHO devoted much of its resources to the ﬁght against the major communicable dis eases.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2530,Mass campaigns were waged against ma laria trachoma yaws and typhus among others.Malaria turned out to be a more complex problemthan anticipated and early efforts at eradicationhad to be scaled back to the level of control.Efforts to improve maternal and child health ser vices included the training of traditional birthattendants an approach advocated by UNICEF WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION 1322WHO s close partner in all child health projects to reduce infant and maternal deaths.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2531,WHO alsofollowed up on the work done by its predecessororganizations on sanitary conventions. It adopted in 1951 the International Sanitary Regulations later in 1971 renamed the International HealthRegulations. Beginning in the 1960s WHO began an effort to extend health services to rural populations. In1974 recognizing the underutilization of existingtechnologies to ﬁght childhood diseases WHOlaunched an expanded immunization programagainst polio measles diphtheria whooping cough tetanus and tuberculosis.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2532,HFA AND PHC Widespread dissatisfaction with health services in the later 1960s and early 1970s led to an effort toﬁnd an alternative approach to standard healthcare and eventually the joint WHO UNICEF con ference in Alma Ata in 1979. The goal of Health for All HFA adopted by member states at the 1977 World Health Assem bly called for the attainment by all people of theworld of a level of health that will permit them tolead a socially and economically productive life.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2533,In1978 WHO and UNICEF cosponsored the histo ric International Conference on Primary HealthCare PHC in Alma Ata at which the interna tional development community adopted PHC asthe key to attaining the goal of Health for All by theyear 2000. PHC as deﬁned at the Alma Ata conference called for a revolutionary redeﬁnition of healthcare.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2534,Instead of the traditional from the top down approach to medical service it embraced the prin ciples of social justice equity self reliance appro priate technology decentralization communityinvolvement intersectoral collaboration and af fordable cost.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2535,The Alma Ata Declaration on PHCenvisaged a minimum package of eight elements 1 education concerning prevailing health prob lems and the methods of preventing and control ling them 2 promotion of food supply and propernutrition 3 an adequate supply of safe water andbasic sanitation 4 maternal and child health including family planning 5 immunization againstthe major infectious diseases 6 prevention andcontrol of locally endemic diseases 7 appropri ate treatment of common diseases and injuries and 8 provision of essential drugs.

Though few if any countries have success fully followed all the precepts of PHC as enunci ated at Alma Ata PHC has since provided thephilosophical linchpin for virtually all subsequentinternational health activities.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2537,In the 1960s andearly 1970s community health workers and tradi tional birth attendants were grudgingly acceptedby many though only as second class health careproviders and they were scorned by others espe cially by some traditionally trained allopathic medi cal practitioners. With Alma Ata however plusthe exemplary success of the work of barefootdoctors in China PHC precepts and programsbecame respectable.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2538,ERADICATION OF SMALLPOX After an exhaustive and intensive effort the last cases of smallpox were identiﬁed and treated inEast Africa. In 1979 a global commission certiﬁedthe worldwide eradication of this ancient scourge.The cost over the decade long campaign came to 300 million a small price to pay for the elimina tion of the disease for which the annual cost ofvaccination worldwide was close to 1 billion.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2539,Noordinary victory this was humankind s ﬁrst con quest of a deadly malady and a clear demonstra tion that investment in health begets economicbeneﬁt as well as humanitarian relief. GLOBAL STRATEGY FOR HFA In 1979 the World Health Assembly adopted the Global Strategy for HFA which was subsequentlyendorsed by the UN General Assembly. The UNresolution was the health community s attempt tomobilize the world community at large to takecollaborative actions to improve the status of theworld s health.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2540,The main thrust of the strategy wasthe development of a health system infrastructure starting with PHC for the delivery of countrywideprograms that would reach the entire population. WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION 1323The strategy called for the application of the prin ciples of the Alma Ata Declaration and the devel opment of the minimum package of the eight PHCelements.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2541,HFA was conceived as a process leading to progressive improvement in the health of peopleand not as a single ﬁnite target though someindicators were recommended. It aims at socialjustice with health resources evenly distributedand essential health service accessible to everyone with full community involvement. While member states all voted to adopt HFA via PHC implementation lagged far behind as economic crises loomed and political and militaryconﬂicts ﬂared.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2542,Natural disasters also intervened.The rapid rise of the urban poor and weaknessesin the organization and management of healthservices resulted in waste and misuse of meagerresources. Above all poverty its deep rooted causesunresolved undermined various efforts in theslow march towards HFA.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2543,CSDR BAMAKO AND ARI In the early 1980s UNICEF launched its Child Survival and Development Revolution CSDR withfour inexpensive interventions growth monitor ing oral rehydration breastfeeding and immuni zation programs commonly referred to as GOBI .After some initial reservation and with assurancesthat GOBI efforts would be within the context ofPHC WHO became an active player in CSDR which has made impressive inroads in reducinginfant deaths especially through the immuniza tion campaign and the oral rehydration programfor the control of diarrhea which also beneﬁtedfrom water and sanitation programs.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2544,WHO also joined UNICEF in launching the Bamako Initiative in the 1980s which aimed at theprovision of essential drugs and their rational usein the context of PHC initially in African coun tries but later expanded to other regions. Theinitiative introduced the element of cost recoveryas well as community management of drug sup plies and sales.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2545,Indeed in spite of the retrogressiveeconomic situation in Africa south of the Sahara inthe 1980s infant mortality and life expectancycontinued to improve gradually in Africa.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2546,Thesegains however have since been brutally reversedby the spread of HIV AIDS.The 1980s also saw WHO initiating a broad scale attack against acute respiratory infections ARI a major cause of child mortality and imple menting the Safe Motherhood program designedto reduce maternal deaths which stood at 500 000avoidable deaths almost all in the developingcountries. In these efforts WHO was joined byUNICEF and the World Bank which had begun toturn some of its attention to the social aspects ofdevelopment.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2547,In the later 1990s the IntegratedManagement of Childhood Illness program waslaunched to bring together a number of programsfor a more rational approach. Though there was progress the PHC imple mentation was found to be limited to a number ofcountries and some speciﬁc areas. The principlesof PHC however were found to be the only viableoption even in the most difﬁcult circumstances with some adjustment of the approaches and strate gies necessary in country speciﬁc situations.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2548,Theeffort to introduce district level PHC did succeedin bringing the services closer to the people whoneed them. THE HIV AIDS PANDEMIC Although HIV AIDS ﬁrst raised its ugly head in the public eye in North America it soon becameclear that the AIDS epidemic was to become apandemic.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2549,Under pressure from WHO a numberof governments and various developments agen cies the pharmaceutical industry has agreed toallow the price of AIDS treatment drugs to dropfrom around 15 000 a year per patient in theindustrialized countries to 350 in the developingcountries. This will encourage more people tocome forward for screening in some countries and in other countries with help from interna tional organizations programs of treatment arenow a possibility.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2550,However the principal way toﬁght AIDS is still prevention through educationand behavioral change as work towards an effec tive vaccine is making very slow progress. While nopart of the world is free of the AIDS threat AIDSspread fast and wide in Africa especially in coun tries south of the Sahara. In Asia where the popu lation pools are much greater the number ofHIV AIDS cases is expected to exceed that ofAfrica by 2005.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2551,In ﬁghting AIDS development agencies of the UN system have joined together to form UNAIDS WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION 1324in which WHO plays the lead technical role. The pandemic is now such a serious threat to entiresocieties that it has been brought to the UN Secu rity Council as a matter of grave security concern. YEAR 2000 GOALS In 1990 WHO joined with UNICEF in urging the UN Summit for Children to set Year 2000 goals.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2552,These goals included increased immunization rates reduction of infant under ﬁve and maternal mor tality rates water and sanitation as well as educa tion for all the reduction of malnutrition and theelimination of micronutrient disorders. After the end of the Cold War the hope for a peace dividend from disarmament did not mate rialize. On the contrary with a few exceptions since that time the volume of development fundsfrom the industrialized countries has shrunk.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2553,The2001 session of the UN General Assembly is likelyto be disappointing in its review of the summitgoals. The water sanitation and education for allgoals will certainly fall far short of target. There isstill hope however for the elimination of polioand guinea worms as well as the virtual elimina tion of iodine deﬁciency disorders.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2554,HEALTH PROMOTION AND OTHER ACTIVITIES In 1982 WHO undertook a reorientation of health education designed to expand its community ap proach and include communication theories andpractice. In 1987 the term health education waschanged to health promotion to denote a broader ecological approach to the work of facilitating informed choices by people on health matters.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2555,The ﬁrst international consultation on this subject was held in Ottawa in 1986 followed byconsultations in Adelaide in 1988 Sundsvall in 1991 and Jakarta in 1997. WHO s new approachcalls for broader societal involvement and in the eastern Mediterranean region member nationsadopted social mobilization as the strategy forhealth promotion. Individual programs such asthe tuberculosis and micronutrient eliminationprograms adopted similar stances.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2556,WHO publishes a number of technical jour nals the most important of which is the WHOBulletin and maintains a media and public rela tions unit.

It is transmitted primarily bythe bite of the Aedes aegypti mosquito and also by Haemogogus mosquitoes in South America.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2570,Though yellow fever caused epidemics in the United States and Europe in earlier centuries today it exists only in Africa and Central and SouthAmerica.There are two main cycles of transmission of yellow fever the sylvatic or jungle cycle and theurban cycle. In the sylvatic cycle the infection ismaintained between monkeys and mosquitoes. Ahuman entering the jungle environment e.g. loggers hunters is at risk if bitten by an infectedmosquito.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2571,Urban yellow fever occurs when thevirus is introduced into urban centers for exam ple by migrant laborers arriving from rural re gions. The domestic mosquito A. aegypti then carries the infection from person to person. Incontrast to jungle yellow fever where only smallnumbers of individuals are at risk urban yellowfever epidemics may be quite extensive.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2572,An intermediate cycle has also been described in Africa in areas where there is increased contactbetween humans monkeys and mosquitoes suchas at the edges of forested areas this is a likelysource of larger urban outbreaks. Following the bite of an infective mosquito the incubation period is three to six days. Althoughsome cases may be asymptomatic or very mild most cases are characterized by sudden onset offever chills myalgias backache headache nau sea and vomiting.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2575,As the clinical presentation of yellow fever is similar to that of other viral hemorrhagic fevers the diagnosis should be conﬁrmed in a laboratory.Diagnosis can be made by culture of the virus or byﬁnding viral antigen in blood or liver tissue. It isalso possible to identify virus speciﬁc antibodies in blood. A live attenuated vaccine against yellow fever is over 95 percent effective and confers protectionfor ten years.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2576,As it is a live vaccine it is contraindi cated in infants under the age of six months inpregnant women and in immunocompromisedindividuals. It should be used with caution inanyone with a history of egg allergy.

L AST SEE ALSO Demography Population at Risk Popula tion Growth Population Policies ZOONOSES Zoonoses or zoonotic diseases are caused by infectious agents that are transmissible under natu ral circumstances from vertebrate animals to hu mans. Zoonoses may arise from wild or domes tic animals or from products of animal origin.Zoonoses have been known since early hystoricaltimes.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2587,There are biblical references to plague abacterial zoonosis mainly transmitted to humans by ﬂeas and some historians contend that a dis ease ﬁrst described by Thucydides during thePlague of Athens 430 425 B.C.E. was typhus a louse borne zoonosis Zinsser . Certain zoonoses such as yellow fever malaria and rabies are wellknown to the general public but a vast number oflesser known zoonoses exist in limited cycles indifferent parts of the world.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2588,There are undoubt edly many zoonoses lurking in nature that have thepotential to cause serious public health conse quences if introduced into humans. This is in fact what may be our greatest concern about zoonoses not the diseases that we know they are capable ofcausing but the hidden potential of what diseasesmight arise in the future.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2589,Examples that foster ourconcern include the emergence of AIDS acquiredimmunodeﬁciency syndrome from nonhuman pri mates which has developed into one of the mostsigniﬁcant infectious disease threats in the worldtoday and the crossing of the species barrier ofcertain inﬂuenza virus strains that have led tolarge human pandemics. Diseases such as AIDSand inﬂuenza have their origins as zoonoses butthey subsequently adapted to human to humantransmission.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2590,There are a number of different types of microbial agents that cause zoonotic diseases andvarious ways humans can become infected withthese agents.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2591,This may best be explained by afew examples 1 Lyme disease a bacterial dis ease transmitted via the bite of an infected tick 2 rabies a viral disease acquired by the biteof an infected animal 3 Ebola hemorrhagic fe ver a viral disease spread by infected blood tis sues secretions or excretions 4 hantaviral dis ease a disease contracted by inhaling aircontaminated with virus infected excreta from ro dents 5 leptospirosis a bacterial disease usuallytransmitted to humans through contact with urinefrom infected animals 6 brucellosis a bacterialdisease contracted by ingestion of unpasteurized ZOONOSES 1332milk and 7 cat scratch disease a disease con tracted through bites or licks of infected cats.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2592,Enteric bacteria such as Salmonella and Escherichia coli and parasites such as Cryptosporidium and Giardia are responsible for major food borne and waterborne disease outbreaks around theworld and recently the nonmicrobial transmissi ble agent of bovine spongiform encephalopathy mad cow disease appears to have crossed over tohumans to produce a degenerative neurologicaldisease known as variant Creutzfeldt Jakob disease.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2593,There has been a disturbing trend of reemergence of previously recognized zoonosesthat were believed to be under control. This hasbeen coupled with the emergence of new zoonoticdiseases.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2594,Numerous factors may account for this including 1 alteration of the environment af fecting the size and distribution of certain animalspecies vectors and transmitters of infectiousagents to humans 2 increasing human popula tions causing an increased level of contact betweenhumans and infected animals 3 industrializationof foods of animal origin that is changes in foodprocessing and consumer nutritional habits 4 increasing movements of people as well as anincreased trade in animals and animal products and 5 decreasing surveillance and control ofsome of the major zoonoses.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2595,Some supposedly new zoonoses have been around for a long timebut have simply not been recognized. For exam ple several types of hantaviruses are transmittedby rodents such as deer mice and can cause thedisease known as hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.This disease has likely been around for decades ifnot centuries but human cases were ﬁrst docu mented only in 1993.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2596,In addition global warminghas the potential to broaden the geographic distri bution and abundance of arthropods as well as thevertebrate hosts in which some zoonoses persist. There is no single clinical picture that can be drawn of zoonoses given the diverse groupof microorganisms that are capable of causingzoonotic diseases.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2597,A partial list of symptoms mayinclude some but not all of the following fever sometimes hemorrhagic headache rash muscleaches arthritis respiratory distress sometimespneumonia abdominal pain vomiting diarrhea jaundice cardiac abnormalities and neurologicalinvolvement ranging from stiff neck to meningitisor encephalitis. The course of disease varies be tween different zoonotic pathogens but can be more severe in the very young or very old or inindividuals who are immunocompromised.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2598,Manyzoonoses can be treated with antimicrobial drugs but there are few drugs that can be used to success fully treat viral zoonoses. Treatment for a knownor suspected exposure to a viral zoonosis such asrabies involves administration of immune globu lin whereas only supportive treatment can beoffered for many other viral zoonoses.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2599,Vaccines are available for the general public for a small number of zoonoses such as Japanese en cephalitis and yellow fever and on a limited basis for individuals perceived to be at occupational orrecreational risk.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2600,In addition chemoprophylacticregimens such as antimalarial drugs are recom mended for travellers to high disease risk areas.The risk of contracting vector borne diseases canbe reduced by avoidance of areas infested byarthropods use of insect repellents and appropri ate clothing the less skin exposed the better .Occasionally it is possible to reduce zoonotic dis ease risks by decreasing the abundance of certainreservoir hosts such as rodents.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2601,Individuals shouldalso not drink untreated water or unpasteurizedmilk. Areas containing potentially contaminated animal material such as rodent excreta should be cleaned using appropriate disinfectants. Patientswith diseases such as Ebola virus should be kept instrict isolation. Diseases such as tularemia andleptospirosis may be contracted by handling in fected animal tissue so trappers should use gloveswhen handling dead animals.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2602,The disease incidence and pattern of occur rence of zoonoses varies greatly between differentregions within a country and between countries.In general zoonoses do not occur in large num bers in the industrialized world. Because of thisrelative infrequency of occurrence some zoonoticinfections may be overlooked and underdiagnosed. Certain individuals may be at greater risk for contracting zoonoses.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2603,These include people withoccupational exposure such as veterinarians farm ers and slaughterhouse workers or individualswho participate in outdoor recreational activities such as hunters. The best defense against contract ing zoonoses is education. Individuals should beaware of the respective zoonoses that may becirculating in their environment and the times of ZOONOSES 1333year of greatest risk for contracting these zoonoses.

General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2615,II The existing gross inequality in the health status of the people particularlybetween developed and developing countries as well as within countries is Appendix 1337politically socially and economically unacceptable and is therefore of common concern to all countries.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2616,III Economic and social development based on a New International EconomicOrder is of basic importance to the fullest attainment of health for all and tothe reduction of the gap between the health status of the developing anddeveloped countries. The promotion and protection of the health of thepeople is essential to sustained economic and social development andcontributes to a better quality of life and to world peace.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2617,IV The people have the right and duty to participate individually and collec tively in the planning and implementation of their health care. V Governments have a responsibility for the health of their people which canbe fulﬁlled only by the provision of adequate health and social measures.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2618,Amain social target of governments international organizations and thewhole world community in the coming decades should be the attainment byall peoples of the world by the year 2000 of a level of health that will permitthem to lead a socially and economically productive life. Primary health careis the key to attaining this target as part of development in the spirit of socialjustice.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2619,VI Primary health care is essential health care based on practical scientiﬁcallysound and socially acceptable methods and technology made universallyaccessible to individuals and families in the community through their fullparticipation and at a cost that the community and country can afford tomaintain at every stage of their development in the spirit of self reliance andself determination.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2620,It forms an integral part both of the country s healthsystem of which it is the central function and main focus and of the overallsocial and economic development of the community. It is the ﬁrst level ofcontact of individuals the family and community with the national healthsystem bringing health care as close as possible to where people live andwork and constitutes the ﬁrst element of a continuing health care process.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2621,VII Primary health care 1. reﬂects and evolves from the economic conditions and sociocultural and political characteristics of the country and itscommunities and is based on the application of the relevantresults of social biomedical and health services research andpublic health experience 2. addresses the main health problems in the community providing promotive preventive curative and rehabilitativeservices accordingly 3. includes at least education concerning prevailing health problems and the methods of preventing and controlling them promotion of food supply and proper nutrition an adequate Appendix 1338supply of safe water and basic sanitation maternal and child health care including family planning immunization against themajor infectious diseases prevention and control of locallyendemic diseases appropriate treatment of common diseasesand injuries and provision of essential drugs 4. involves in addition to the health sector all related sectors and aspects of national and community development in particularagriculture animal husbandry food industry education hous ing public works communications and other sectors anddemands the coordinated efforts of all those sectors 5. requires and promotes maximum community and individual self reliance and participation in the planning organization opera tion and control of primary health care making fullest use oflocal national and other available resources and to this enddevelops through appropriate education the ability of communi ties to participate 6. should be sustained by integrated functional and mutually supportive referral systems leading to the progressive improve ment of comprehensive health care for all and giving priority tothose most in need 7. relies at local and referral levels on health workers including physicians nurses midwives auxiliaries and community workersas applicable as well as traditional practitioners as needed suitably trained socially and technically to work as a health teamand to respond to the expressed health needs of the community.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2622,VIII All governments should formulate national policies strategies and plans ofaction to launch and sustain primary health care as part of a comprehensivenational health system and in coordination with other sectors. To this end itwill be necessary to exercise political will to mobilize the country s re sources and to use available external resources rationally.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2623,IX All countries should cooperate in a spirit of partnership and service toensure primary health care for all people since the attainment of health bypeople in any one country directly concerns and beneﬁts every othercountry. In this context the joint WHO UNICEF report on primary healthcare constitutes a solid basis for the further development and operation ofprimary health care throughout the world.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2624,X An acceptable level of health for all the people of the world by the year 2000can be attained through a fuller and better use of the world s resources aconsiderable part of which is now spent on armaments and military conﬂicts.A genuine policy of independence peace détente and disarmament couldand should release additional resources that could well be devoted topeaceful aims and in particular to the acceleration of social and economicdevelopment of which primary health care as an essential part should beallotted its proper share.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2625,Appendix 1339The International Conference on Primary Health Care calls for urgent and effective national and international action to develop and implement pri mary health care throughout the world and particularly in developingcountries in a spirit of technical cooperation and in keeping with a NewInternational Economic Order.

World Scientists Warning to Humanity The Warning was written on November 18 1992 and was subsequently signed by over 1 500 scientists from all countries. The full text of the Warning appears below. It is also available via the Internet http www.ucsusa.org about warning.html.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2648,INTRODUCTION Human beings and the natural world are on a collision course. Human activities inﬂict harsh and often irreversible damage on the environment andon critical resources. If not checked many of our current practices put atserious risk the future that we wish for human society and the plant andanimal kingdoms and may so alter the living world that it will be unable tosustain life in the manner that we know.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2649,Fundamental changes are urgent ifwe are to avoid the collision our present course will bring about. Appendix 1344THE ENVIRONMENT The environment is suffering critical stress The Atmosphere Stratospheric ozone depletion threatens us with enhanced ultra violet radia tion at the Earth s surface which can be damaging or lethal to many lifeforms. Air pollution near ground level and acid precipitation are alreadycausing widespread injury to humans forests and crops.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2650,Water Resources Heedless exploitation of depletable ground water supplies endangers foodproduction and other essential human systems. Heavy demands on theworld s surface waters have resulted in serious shortages in some 80 coun tries containing 40 of the world s population. Pollution of rivers lakes and ground water further limits the supply. Oceans Destructive pressure on the oceans is severe particularly in the coastalregions which produce most of the world s food ﬁsh.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2651,The total marine catchis now at or above the estimated maximum sustainable yield. Some ﬁsherieshave already shown signs of collapse. Rivers carrying heavy burdens oferoded soil into the seas also carry industrial municipal agricultural andlivestock waste some of it toxic. Soil Loss of soil productivity which is causing extensive land abandonment is awidespread byproduct of current practices in agriculture and animal hus bandry.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2652,Since 1945 11 of the Earth s vegetated surface has been degraded an area larger than India and China combined and per capita foodproduction in many parts of the world is decreasing. Forests Tropical rain forests as well as tropical and temperate dry forests are beingdestroyed rapidly. At present rates some critical forest types will be gone in afew years and most of the tropical rain forest will be gone before the end ofthe next century. With them will go large numbers of plant and animalspecies.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2653,Living Species The irreversible loss of species which by 2100 may reach one third of allspecies now living is especially serious. We are losing the potential they holdfor providing medicinal and other beneﬁts and the contribution thatgenetic diversity of life forms gives to the robustness of the world s biologicalsystems and to the astonishing beauty of the Earth itself. Much of this damage is irreversible on a scale of centuries or permanent. Other processes appear to pose additional threats.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2654,Increasing levels of gasesin the atmosphere from human activities including carbon dioxide releasedfrom fossil fuel burning and from deforestation may alter climate on aglobal scale. Predictions of global warming are still uncertain with pro jected effects ranging from tolerable to very severe but the potential risksare very great.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2655,Our massive tampering with the world s interdependent web of life coupled with the environmental damage inﬂicted by deforestation species Appendix 1345loss and climate change could trigger widespread adverse effects includ ing unpredictable collapses of critical biological systems whose interactionsand dynamics we only imperfectly understand. Uncertainty over the extent of these effects cannot excuse complacency or delay in facing the threat. POPULATION The Earth is ﬁnite.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2656,Its ability to absorb wastes and destructive efﬂuent is ﬁnite. Its ability to provide food and energy is ﬁnite. Its ability to provide forgrowing numbers of people is ﬁnite. And we are fast approaching many ofthe Earth s limits. Current economic practices which damage the environ ment in both developed and underdeveloped nations cannot be continuedwithout the risk that vital global systems will be damaged beyond repair.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2657,Pressures resulting from unrestrained population growth put demands on the natural world that can overwhelm any efforts to achieve a sustainablefuture. If we are to halt the destruction of our environment we must acceptlimits to that growth. A World Bank estimate indicates that world populationwill not stabilize at less than 12.4 billion while the United Nations concludesthat the eventual total could reach 14 billion a near tripling of today s 5.4billion.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2658,But even at this moment one person in ﬁve lives in absolute povertywithout enough to eat and one in ten suffers serious malnutrition. No more than one or a few decades remain before the chance to avert the threats we now confront will be lost and the prospects for humanity immeasurably diminished. WARNING We the undersigned senior members of the world s scientiﬁc community hereby warn all humanity of what lies ahead.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2659,A great change in ourstewardship of the Earth and the life on it is required if vast human misery isto be avoided and our global home on this planet is not to be irretrievablymutilated. WHAT WE MUST DO Five inextricably linked areas must be addressed simultaneously 1. We must bring environmentally damaging activities under control to restore and protect the integrity of the Earth s systemswe depend on.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2660,We must for example move away from fossilfuels to more benign inexhaustible energy sources to cutgreenhouse gas emissions and the pollution of our air and water.Priority must be given to the development of energy sourcesmatched to Third World needs small scale and relatively easyto implement. We must halt deforestation injury to and loss ofagricultural land and the loss of terrestrial and marine plant andanimal species. 2. We must manage resources crucial to human welfare more effectively.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2661,We must give high priority to efﬁcient use of energy Appendix 1346water and other materials including expansion of conservation and recycling. 3. We must stabilize population. This will be possible only if all nations recognize that it requires improved social and economicconditions and the adoption of effective voluntary familyplanning. 4. We must reduce and eventually eliminate poverty.5. We must ensure sexual equality and guarantee women control over their own reproductive decisions.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2662,DEVELOPED NATIONS MUST ACT NOW The developed nations are the largest polluters in the world today. They must greatly reduce their overconsumption if we are to reduce pressures onresources and the global environment. The developed nations have theobligation to provide aid and support to developing nations because onlythe developed nations have the ﬁnancial resources and the technical skillsfor these tasks.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2663,Acting on this recognition is not altruism but enlightened self interest whether industrialized or not we all have but one lifeboat. No nation canescape from injury when global biological systems are damaged. No nationcan escape from conﬂicts over increasingly scarce resources. In addition environmental and economic instabilities will cause mass migrations withincalculable consequences for developed and undeveloped nations alike.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2664,Developing nations must realize that environmental damage is one of the gravest threats they face and that attempts to blunt it will be overwhelmed iftheir populations go unchecked. The greatest peril is to become trapped inspirals of environmental decline poverty and unrest leading to social economic and environmental collapse. Success in this global endeavor will require a great reduction in violence and war.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2665,Resources now devoted to the preparation and conduct of war amounting to over 1 trillion annually will be badly needed in the newtasks and should be diverted to the new challenges. A new ethic is required a new attitude towards discharging our responsibil ity for caring for ourselves and for the Earth. We must recognize the Earth slimited capacity to provide for us. We must recognize its fragility. We mustno longer allow it to be ravaged.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2666,This ethic must motivate a great movement convince reluctant leaders and reluctant governments and reluctant peoplesthemselves to effect the needed changes. The scientists issuing this warning hope that our message will reach and affect people everywhere. We need the help of many.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2667,We require the help of the world community of scientists natural social economic political We require the help of the world s business and industrial leaders We require the help of the world s religious leaders and Appendix 1347 We require the help of the world s peoples. We call on all to join us in this task.

Below is the complete text of the introduction. Available via the Internet http www.health.gov healthypeople document .
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2694,INTRODUCTION Healthy People 2010 presents a comprehensive nationwide health promo tion and disease prevention agenda. It is designed to serve as a roadmap forimproving the health of all people in the United States during the ﬁrstdecade of the 21st century.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2695,Like the preceding Healthy People 2000 initiative which was driven by an ambitious yet achievable 10 year strategy for improving the nation s healthby the end of the 20th century Healthy People 2010 is committed to asingle overarching purpose promoting health and preventing illness disa bility and premature death. THE HISTORY BEHIND THE HEALTHY PEOPLE 2010 INITIATIVE Healthy People 2010 builds on initiatives pursued over the past two decades.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2696,In 1979 Healthy People The Surgeon General s Report on Health Promotion and Disease Prevention provided national goals for reducing premature deaths and preserving independence for older adults. In 1980 another report Promoting Health Preventing Disease Objectives for the Nation set forth 226 targeted health objectives for the Nation to achieve over the next 10 years.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2697,Healthy People 2000 National Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Objec tives released in 1990 identiﬁed health improvement goals and objectives to be reached by the year 2000. The Healthy People 2010 initiative continues inthis tradition as an instrument to improve health for the ﬁrst decade of the21st century.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2698,THE DEVELOPMENT OF HEALTHY PEOPLE 2010 GOALS AND OBJECTIVES Healthy People 2010 represents the ideas and expertise of a diverse range of individuals and organizations concerned about the nation s health. TheHealthy People Consortium an alliance of more than 350 national organi zations and 250 State public health mental health substance abuse andenvironmental agencies conducted three national meetings on the devel opment of Healthy People 2010.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2699,In addition many individuals and organiza tions gave testimony about health priorities at ﬁve Healthy People 2010regional meetings held in late 1998. On two occasions in 1997 and in 1998 the American public was given the opportunity to share its thoughts and ideas. More than 11 000 comments ondraft materials were received by mail or via the Internet from individuals inevery State the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2700,All the comments Appendix 1354received during the development of Healthy People 2010 can be viewed on the Healthy People Web site http www.health.gov healthypeople .
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2701,The ﬁnal Healthy People 2010 objectives were developed by teams of experts from a variety of Federal agencies under the direction of Health andHuman Services Secretary Donna Shalala Assistant Secretary for Health andSurgeon General David Satcher and former Assistant Secretaries for Health.The process was coordinated by the Ofﬁce of Disease Prevention and HealthPromotion U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2702,THE GOALS OF HEALTHY PEOPLE Healthy People 2010 is designed to achieve two overarching goals Increase quality and years of healthy life. Eliminate health disparities. These two goals are supported by speciﬁc objectives in 28 focus areas. Each objective was developed with a target to be achieved by the year 2010.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2703,THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL AND COMMUNITY HEALTH Over the years it has become clear that individual health is closely linked to community health the health of the community and environment in whichindividuals live work and play. Likewise community health is profoundlyaffected by the collective beliefs attitudes and behaviors of everyone wholives in the community.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2704,Indeed the underlying premise of Healthy People 2010 is that the health of the individual is almost inseparable from the health of the larger communityand that the health of every community in every State and territory deter mines the overall health status of the Nation. That is why the vision forHealthy People 2010 is Healthy People in Healthy Communities.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2705,HOW HEALTHY PEOPLE 2010 WILL IMPROVE THE NATION S HEALTH One of the most compelling and encouraging lessons learned from the Healthy People 2000 initiative is that we as a nation can make dramaticprogress in improving the nation s health in a relatively short period of time.For example during the past decade we achieved signiﬁcant reductions ininfant mortality. Childhood vaccinations are at the highest levels everrecorded in the United States.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2706,Fewer teenagers are becoming parents.Overall alcohol tobacco and illicit drug use is leveling off. Death rates forcoronary heart disease and stroke have declined. Signiﬁcant advances havebeen made in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer and in reducingunintentional injuries. But we still have a long way to go. Diabetes and other chronic conditions continue to present a serious obstacle to public health. Violence and abusivebehavior continue to ravage homes and communities across the country.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2707,Appendix 1355Mental disorders continue to go undiagnosed and untreated. Obesity in adults has increased 50 percent over the past two decades. Nearly 40 percentof adults engage in no leisure time physical activity. Smoking amongadolescents has increased in the past decade. And HIV AIDS remains aserious health problem now disproportionately affecting women and com munities of color.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2708,Healthy People 2010 will be the guiding instrument for addressing these and emerging health issues reversing unfavorable trends and expanding pastachievements in health. THE KEY ROLE OF COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS Community partnerships particularly when they reach out to nontraditional partners can be among the most effective tools for improving health incommunities.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2709,For the past two decades Healthy People has been used as a strategic management tool for the federal government states communities andmany other public and private sector partners. Virtually all states theDistrict of Columbia and Guam have developed their own Healthy Peopleplans modeled after the national plan. Most states have tailored the nationalobjectives to their speciﬁc needs.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2710,Businesses local governments and civic professional and religious organi zations also have been inspired by Healthy People to print immunizationreminders set up hotlines change cafeteria menus begin communityrecycling establish worksite ﬁtness programs assess school health educationcurriculums sponsor health fairs and engage in myriad other activities.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2711,EVERYONE CAN HELP ACHIEVE THE HEALTHY PEOPLE 2010 OBJECTIVES Addressing the challenge of health improvement is a shared responsibility that requires the active participation and leadership of the federal govern ment states local governments policymakers health care providers profes sionals business executives educators community leaders and the Ameri can public itself.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2712,Although administrative responsibility for the HealthyPeople 2010 initiative rests in the U.S. Department of Health and HumanServices representatives of all these diverse groups shared their experience expertise and ideas in developing the Healthy People 2010 goals andobjectives. Healthy People 2010 however is just the beginning. The biggest challenges still stand before us and we all have a role in building a healthier nation.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2713,Regardless of your age gender education level income race ethnicity cultural customs language religious beliefs disability sexual orientation geographic location or occupation Healthy People 2010 is designed to be avaluable resource in determining how you can participate most effectively inimproving the nation s health.

Below some portions of the Charter have been excerpted and others summarized. The full text of the Charter is available via the Internet http www.who.dk policy ottawa.htm. Health Promotion Health promotion is the process of enabling people to increase controlover and to improve their health.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2716,To reach a state of complete physical mental and social well being an individual or group must be able to identifyand to realize aspirations to satisfy needs and to change or cope with theenvironment. Health is therefore seen as a resource for everyday life notthe objective of living. Health is a positive concept emphasizing social andpersonal resources as well as physical capacities.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2717,Therefore health promo tion is not just the responsibility of the health sector but goes beyondhealthy lifestyles to well being. Prerequisites for Health The fundamental conditions and resources for health are peace shelter education food income a stable ecosystem sustainable resources socialjustice and equity. Improvement in health requires a secure foundation inthese basic prerequisites.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2718,Advocate Good health is a major resource for social economic and personaldevelopment and an important dimension of quality of life. Political economic social cultural environmental behavioral and biological factorscan all favor health or be harmful to it. Health promotion action aims atmaking these conditions favorable through advocacy for health. Enable Health promotion focuses on achieving equity in health.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2719,Health promotionaction aims at reducing differences in current health status and ensuringequal opportunities and resources to enable all people to achieve theirfullest health potential. This includes a secure foundation in a supportiveenvironment access to information life skills and opportunities for makinghealthy choices. People cannot achieve their fullest health potential unlessthey are able to take control of those things which determine their health.This must apply equally to women and men.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2720,Mediate The prerequisites and prospects for health cannot be ensured by the healthsector alone. More importantly health promotion demands coordinated Appendix 1357action by all concerned by governments by health and other social and economic sectors by nongovernmental and voluntary organizations bylocal authorities by industry and by the media. People in all walks of life areinvolved as individuals families and communities.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2721,Professional and socialgroups and health personnel have a major responsibility to mediate betweendiffering interests in society for the pursuit of health. Health promotion strategies and programs should be adapted to the local needs and possibilities of individual countries and regions to take into account differing social cultural and economic systems.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2722,Health Promotion Action Means The Charter deﬁnes health promotion in terms of the following activities building healthy public policy in the full range of administrative andlegislative action creating supportive environments via a socioecologicalapproach to health strengthening community action and democratic plan ning processes developing personal skills via education and reorientinghealth services toward health promotion in addition to curative services.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2723,Moving into the Future Citing caring holism and ecology as central issues the signatories to theCharter pledged to promote health in various ways including advocating aclear political commitment to health and equity in all sectors counteractingtrends and products that harm health reorienting health services towardhealth promotion recognizing health and its maintenance as a major socialinvestment.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2724,Call for International Action The Charter concludes with a statement calling on the World HealthOrganization and other international bodies to advocate the promotionof health. The Nuremberg Code Below is an excerpt from the Nuremberg Code. The complete text is available via the Internet http www.ushmm.org research doctors Nuremberg_Code.htm.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2725,Permissible Medical Experiments The great weight of the evidence before us is to the effect that certain types ofmedical experiments on human beings when kept within reasonably well deﬁned bounds conform to the ethics of the medical profession generally.The protagonists of the practice of human experimentation justify theirviews on the basis that such experiments yield results for the good of societythat are unprocurable by other methods or means of study.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2726,All agree however that certain basic principles must be observed in order to satisfymoral ethical and legal concepts 1. The voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2727,This means that the person involved should have legalcapacity to give consent should be so situated as to be able to Appendix 1358exercise free power of choice without the intervention of any element of force fraud deceit duress over reaching or otherulterior form of constraint or coercion and should havesufﬁcient knowledge and comprehension of the elements of thesubject matter involved as to enable him to make anunderstanding and enlightened decision.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2728,This latter elementrequires that before the acceptance of an afﬁrmative decision bythe experimental subject there should be made known to himthe nature duration and purpose of the experiment themethod and means by which it is to be conducted all inconveniences and hazards reasonably to be expected and the effects upon his health or person which may possibly come fromhis participation in the experiment.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2729,The duty and responsibilityfor ascertaining the quality of the consent rests upon eachindividual who initiates directs or engages in the experiment. Itis a personal duty and responsibility which may not be delegatedto another with impunity. 2. The experiment should be such as to yield fruitful results for the good of society unprocurable by other methods or means ofstudy and not random and unnecessary in nature. 3.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2730,The experiment should be so designed and based on the results of animal experimentation and a knowledge of the naturalhistory of the disease or other problem under study thatthe anticipated results will justify the performance of theexperiment. 4. The experiment should be so conducted as to avoid all unnecessary physical and mental suffering and injury. 5.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2731,No experiment should be conducted where there is an a priori reason to believe that death or disabling injury will occur except perhaps in those experiments where the experimentalphysicians also serve as subjects. 6. The degree of risk to be taken should never exceed that determined by the humanitarian importance of the problem tobe solved by the experiment. 7.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2732,Proper preparations should be made and adequate facilities provided to protect the experimental subject against even remotepossibilities of injury disability or death. 8. The experiment should be conducted only by scientiﬁcally qualiﬁed persons. The highest degree of skill and care should berequired through all stages of the experiment of those whoconduct or engage in the experiment. 9.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2733,During the course of the experiment the human subject should be at liberty to bring the experiment to an end if he has reachedthe physical or mental state where continuation of theexperiment seems to him to be impossible. 10.
General,Uncategorized,Encyclopedia_of_Public_Health.pdf,2734,During the course of the experiment the scientist in charge must be prepared to terminate the experiment at any stage if he Appendix 1359has probable cause to believe in the exercise of the good faith superior skill and careful judgment required of him that acontinuation of the experiment is likely to result in injury disability or death to the experimental subject.
